"Here are a few of the major differences:

    Direction of information flow - DBpedia extracts information from Wikipedia, Wikidata provides it to Wikipedia.
    Structure - DBpedia does it's best to apply structure to textual information from Wikipedia, while Wikidata information is structured natively to start
    Maturity - DBpedia is older, Wikidata is just getting started
    Notability - DBpedia inherits Wikipedia's white, western, male sense of "notablity" while Wikidata has no notability rules (yet â€” and Wikipedias can choose not to include Wikidata information that they don't think qualifies as "notable")
