Recommended for students who have had a previous (high-school level) Calculus course. Not open to students who have credit for MATH 101. This course is about how to view the world from the perspective of classical mechanics, based on an understanding of the core concepts and theoretical laws. As a science foundation course, it helps students appreciate the elegant simplicity of the universal laws governing the complex systems surrounding us, and it teaches an important approach to identifying, formulating, and solving problems encountered in the physical world. The course begins with the core concepts of classical mechanics  _  time, space, mass, force, work, energy, momentum  _  and the physical laws that link them with each other. Students first learn NewtonÕs laws and the universal law of gravitation as they apply to point mass systems. Subsequently, basic concepts of oscillation and waves, rigid body motion, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are introduced, illustrated with real-life examples (e.g., physics of cooking, biosphere as a thermal engine) to help students integrate different science foundation courses by themselves.  While no previous knowledge of Physics is required, some background is advantageous. With an integrated approach, this course examines basic concepts and fundamental principles in chemistry based on the laws of physics. The course starts with an introduction to the static structures of atoms, molecules and matter including life itself, followed by an exploration of the dynamical and collective processes during chemical reactions. It explains how atoms, the basic building blocks of matter, interact with each other and construct the world around us, how subatomic electrons modulate the chemical properties of elements, and how the rearrangement of atoms during chemical reactions gives rise to astonishing phenomena in nature. Centered on topics in chemistry, this course not only prepares students for upper-level disciplinary courses, but also helps students develop an interdisciplinary molecular perspective, which allows them to tackle problems in various fields such as condensed matter physics, molecular biology, medicine, materials science and environmental science. While no previous knowledge is required, some background is advantageous. Not open to students who have credits for both INTGSCI 101 and 102 or CHEM 120 Integrated Science-Biology employs five themes that describe properties of life and will be reiterated over again in Integrated Science-Biology: Organization (Structure and Function), Cycling of Energy and Matter, Information (Genetic Variation), Homeostasis (Interactions), and Evolution. These themes will be unified under the organizational principles of the Scientific Methods, formulating hypothesis and testing hypothesis with experiments. Students in Integrated Science-Biology will develop the understanding of key concepts in the context of cross-talks with chemistry and physics.

People everywhere ponder and debate fundamental questions: What does it mean to be human? How is society to be ordered? What is a moral life? Our ancestors asked such questions as well: it is likely that those questions lie at the origins of humanity itself. They also provide the foundations for much of the most important research in the social sciences today. This course examines the ways in which social scientists from a diversity of disciplines approach these fundamental questions. Study material for the course will include foundational texts from across the social sciences, as well as cutting-edge research from the present day. This course will not attempt to answer these vast questions, or provide neat solutions for students: rather, we want to excite students about the social sciences and whet their appetites for further study. This course will introduce students to common statistics used in social science research articles and the media with the goal of making them informed and critical consumers of research results reported by various sources. Students will gain understanding of the conceptual basis and purpose of different statistics, as well as the formulas for deriving them. The relationship of statistical analysis to other components of the research process will be explicated. The course will be taught using team-based learning with an emphasis on the application of new concepts, knowledge, and skills in the classroom. Application activities will include interpreting statistics presented in tables and graphics in research articles and the media, critiquing conclusions drawn from statistics, and using statistical software, such as SPSS or Stata, to conduct statistical tests and generate tables and graphics. This course provides a broad overview of the research methods and applications of behavioral science. It introduces core phenomena of human behavior including but not limited to decision making, perception and action, and group interactions. It also considers how behavior is influenced by institutions (e.g., governmental policies, business, environment). The course is expressly interdisciplinary, drawing upon theories and empirical research in psychology, behavioral economics, political science, and other social sciences. This course introduces students to the primary empirical approaches in behavioral science through a combination of directed readings and hands-on experience with the primary methods in the field. Students will design, conduct, and analyze experiments that explore perception, action, and decision making in a laboratory setting. Students will also explore complex social behavior by implementing online experiments and analyzing the resulting data. This course is a team-taught, question-driven introduction to the certificate and the fundamentals of how humans make decisions. The primary goal is to provide hands-on and problem-focused instruction designed to connect students to research as quickly as possible. Substantive topics include behavioral and experimental economics, consumer behavior and marketing research, game theory, medical decision making, neuroeconomics, and political psychology. Through this course, students will gain a deeper appreciation of how the behavior of individuals is influenced by macroscopic factors: group memberships and identity, commercial and political institutions, and cultural and societal norms. Sample topics include voting behavior, legal decision making, how diversity shapes group dynamics, cross-cultural differences in perception and decision making, and the rise and fall of cultural memes. The course will also explore the incorporation of behavioral science into public policy through ÒnudgesÓ that can shape individual behavior. Broad survey of the field of modern psychology. The main goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to the important topics, theories, research, and applications in psychology. Building upon the foundational courses in this disciplinary track, this course explores how psychological processes shape human judgment and decision making. Core concepts include understanding rational choice models and their limitations; decision variables like probability, ambiguity, and risk; applications of heuristics to decision making; effective and ineffective uses of incentives; decision rules and aids; and types of interventions that can shape choices. Overview of cognitive processes including pattern recognition, concept formation, attention, memory, imagery, mental representation, language, problem solving, and modes of thinking. The basic approach is both empirical (using data collection and analysis) and theoretical (building models using inductive/deductive reasoning). Application of basic laboratory results to cognition in everyday life. Overview of the cognitive, social, and emotional changes that occur throughout the lifespan, with emphasis on the period from infancy to adolescence. Examines both the empirical evidence and the theoretical models used in understanding human psychological development. Effects of social interaction and social processes on a wide range of individual attitudes and behaviors (for example, conformity, leadership, prejudice, aggression, altruism). Emphasis on the logic, reasoning, research designs, and methods by which knowledge is generated. This course provides a broad overview of abnormal psychology. Areas of focus include: Reviewing different theoretical perspectives for conceptualizing abnormal behavior; Approaches to the diagnosis and assessment of psychopathology; Major classes of psychopathology including how they are defined and treated; Current research, methods, and theories in the field of abnormal psychology. The biological bases of higher brain function, including perception, attention, memory, language, emotion, executive functions and consciousness. Emphasis on human brain function at the macroscopic network-level, and the current theories and controversies in this rapidly growing field. An introduction to the methods, models, and reasoning that have led to discoveries about brain-behavior relations, and a critical evaluation of the current theories that guide our thinking about the neurobiology, development and evolution of sensory and cognitive processes, sleep, pain, emotion, hunger, and thirst as well as maternal and sexual behavior patterns. The field of Behavioral Finance uses psychology to explain anomalies that we observe in the financial marketsÑinvestment behavior that are not consistent with the classical economic models of rational decision-making. In behavioral models, we recognize that individuals (and markets) may behave irrationally, sometimes for extended periods of time.  Using some of the more popular and accepted theories of human behavior from the fields of psychology and decision-making, we will characterize some prevalent features of irrational behavior in the financial markets. We will discuss typical errors made by financial market participants as a result of behavioral biases, and examine the extent to which irrationality can affect financial markets at the aggregate level (ÒbubblesÓ), how long irrationality may persist, and what factors will eventually cause these bubbles to burst (ÒcrashesÓ). This course explores commonalities and differences in behavior across species, with a particular focus on how behavior has been shaped by evolutionary pressures (e.g., ecological niches). It will identify ways in which human behavior is mirrored in other great ape species, while also considering evidence for and against uniquely human behavioral capacities. The course will draw upon concepts from psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and related disciplines. This course investigates the interrelations between the experimental methods of the social/neural sciences and the fundamental questions of philosophy. Students will consider whether and how empirical research could influence a range of philosophical ideas; key topics include the nature of free will, questions of personal responsibility, and ethical judgments and decisions. The limitations of empirical methods – and the challenges of integrating theories across disciplines – will also be explored.  This course introduces research methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so the course considers approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine. Primary interest is the study of causal inference. Global health researchers, practitioners, and donors need to know what programs and interventions ÒworkÓ and why. To answer questions of impact, the course explores randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research, and spends significant time helping students understand the rationale, process, and limitations of field experiments. Randomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. The course reviews several approaches, considers relevant threats to causal inference, and discusses how to improve non-experimental research designs. The course also covers research basics, such as developing and testing theory, asking good questions, understanding variability, designing good measurement, and selecting research participants. The latter part of the course turns to more specialized topics in global health research, such as cost effectiveness, community based participatory research, research on humanitarian aid, and monitoring and evaluation. Students will learn how to evaluate published and unpublished research and how to design a global health research project. Examines the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system, with a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior. Students learn the anatomy and function of neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation, motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion, and related cognitive faculties. Provides the foundation for neurological sciences, including understanding the impairments of sensation, action, and cognition that accompany injury, disease, or dysfunction in the human central nervous system. Mindfulness-based therapies are based in Eastern and Western philosophies, theories, and research. They have been shown to be significantly helpful for stress-related problems, mental health problems, and medical disorders.  Mindfulness-based therapies are also revolutionizing the way that psychologists think about and treat human suffering.  In this course, we will explore the theories, techniques, and research on mindfulness-based therapies from Eastern and Western traditions. A combination of lecturing, class discussion, and experiential exercises will be used to help students gain a well-developed understanding of this important area of psychological research and practice.  Students will also acquire basic skills in how to use mindfulness-based techniques to reduce stress and distress. Public policy should be informed by evidence and facts, but it cannot be determined by them.  People disagree about public policy not only because they disagree about empirical matters but also because they hold different understandings of familiar political concepts and they assign different weightings to competing political values.  This course aims both to illustrate these general propositions and, more importantly, to introduce the tools and techniques with which one can construct and critique reasoned arguments about the political concepts and values that underpin policy choice.  The course will be divided into four sections, each of which focuses on a set of contemporary policy disputes whose resolution depends upon clarifying and justifying our understanding of an underlying political concept and its associated values.  The four concepts whose policy implications we shall explore are: democracy, justice, liberty, and rights.  Readings are mostly works of contemporary political philosophy. Are political ideologies ingrained in our DNA? Why do neurological and physiological processes  define our political preferences? Why do we get angry when discussing politics? Can we estimate the causal effect of cultures on individual political behavior? This course introduces you to advanced research topics in political psychology—a discipline that applies rigorous psychological and statistical methods to the analysis of political behavior. First, we will examine the genetic and environmental origins of political beliefs. Second, we will learn how our brain processes political information. Finally, we will explore the dynamic formation of political norms and their expression and change under various political institutions. Are political ideologies ingrained in our DNA?

Individuals are embedded in a network of relationships used to exchange information and favors, access economic opportunities and share risk. The structure of these relationships determine the individualÕs opportunities and the aggregate outcomes of social and economic systems. The course will discuss the typical properties of network structures (e.g. 6-degrees of separation, clustering, homophily and segregation), how network ties are formed and how agents interact through these ties. Students will learn about a wide range of applications, including the spread of diseases, fashions and political opinion; financial networks; networks in organizations and the labor market; online social networks, etc. Individuals are embedded in a network of relationships used to exchange information and favors, access economic opportunities and share risk.

It is organized around a series of case studies that illustrate applications of behavioral science to different domains; students will work in groups to analyze those applications and their impact upon society. Topics will be drawn from both past and current events, and could include legal decision making, the impact of nudging policies upon disadvantaged groups, new intrusive forms of marketing, the rise of misinformation in news media, or how advances in technology limit human behavior (e.g., self-driving cars). Students will gain skills in analyzing complex problems, formulating policies, and communicating potential solutions. Explore the wide spectrum of methods commonly used in the field of neuroscience, ranging from molecular/genetic to electrophysiology and whole brain imaging. Multiple units of this team-based learning course will include interaction with a scientist currently practicing the technique. This course will focus on how brain mechanisms enable behavior. We will examine the neural basis of homeostatic control, voluntary actions, motivation, emotion, and decision making. We will use systems analysis to elucidate how volition, intentionality, and purpose can be emergent properties of neuronal interactions. We will also explore how different neurological and psychiatric disorders can result from specific defects in hierarchical neural networks. Addiction, mental health disorders. Students will explore a variety of computational models that have been applied to brain physiology and function. The course will emphasize both understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of those models and applying those models within simulations or data analyses. It will span levels of analysis from neural circuits (e.g., computations in local populations of neurons) to high-level cognition and behavior (e.g., coding properties within sensory systems). The course will include hands-on laboratory exercises; thus, prior programming experience is recommended.  To be updated To be udpated Computation and Problem Solving is recognized as a key skill set for all 21st century learners.  This course will focus on the key aspects of computational thinking: Tasks as a series of steps (algorithms); Problem solution at many levels of detail (abstraction); Solving large problems involves breaking it down into a set of smaller problems (decomposition); New problems are likely related to other problems the learner has already solved (pattern recognition); Solutions to a problem may be used to solve a whole range of similar problems (generalization). A wide-ranging survey of how computational media forms enable us to imagine and re-invent our help us to understand, interpret, and represent the past, negotiate present-day challenges, and build the future. Objects of computational exploration and analysis considered in this course will come from the sciences, education, industry, the arts, and entertainment, with the goal of understanding how computational methods cut across traditional disciplinary boundaries, and how advances in one area affect development in another. The course also includes study of the social, ethical, and cultural consequences of digitization, automation, artificial intelligence, and the globalized information and communication systems facilitated by computation. This course provides an introduction to design as a critical and creative practice within the context of computational domains. Topics covered include concepts in graphic and information design, including synergies, resonances, and contradictions between mathematical and artistic approaches and traditions. The course also includes an introduction to design thinking as a trans-disciplinary phenomenon encompassing iterative development cycles, structured and emergent behaviors, divergent thinking, and transferable methods. The emphasis will be on both scientific and artistic approaches to knowledge production, creativity, and communication, and how cross-functional project teams can work together in generative and productive ways. This course covers uninformed search, informed search, constraint satisfaction, classical planning, neural network, deep learning, hidden Markov model, Bayesian network, Markov decision process, reinforcement learning, active learning and game theory.

This course covers neural network, deep belief network, Boltzmann machine, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and deep learning applications for speech, image, video, etc. to be updated This course explores the interdisciplinary conversation between economics and artificial intelligence (AI). In experiential education, this course shows how the two disciplines advance each other by an explainable AI approach: economics makes AI more explainable by clarifying causal relationship and AI empowers economic applications by increasing efficiency. Advanced research in Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Behavioral and Experimental Economics is covered with both general literature review and a case study. The course concludes with a capstone project where students produce academic research and automated products collaboratively in a team of Economist, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer. This course covers interdisciplinary applications of data analysis for social science, behavioral modeling, health care, financial modeling, advanced manufacturing, etc. Students are expected to solve a number of practical problems by implementing data algorithms with R during their course projects. This course covers maximum likelihood estimation, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, linear regression, Bayesian inference, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Students are not allowed to take both MATH 405 and STATS 302 because of the content overlap. Students who are planning to major in Data Science should take STATS 302. to be updated This course covers speech production and perception, feature extraction, template-based recognition, hidden Markov modeling, language model, sub-word units, robust recognition and applications. Training in close reading and analysis of text remains a foundational skill in the arts and humanities, whether the text is literary or documentary. This core course combines practical training in close reading of a variety of texts, with strategies of analysis that are theoretically informed without, however, offering a comprehensive treatment of theory per se. The course will focus both on reading and analysis of literary texts, and on the nuanced unpacking of documents (official, unofficial, personal) with a view to historical method. This class will train students to develop skill and sophistication in viewing and analysis of images, including art objects, film, and new media; and in sound studies, including sonic culture, film music, and traditional musical arts. The goal is audiovisual literacy Ð the creation and interpretation of sound and image that has become central to the ways we experience and understand the world. This core course combines practical training (how to see, how to hear) with a variety of modes of analysis. to be updated to be updated to be updated to be updated to be updated to be updated to be updated Interaction & Physical Computing is a course that explores the object-oriented programming and physical computing for artists and designers. Through looking at development environments such as Processing and Arduino, paired with physical components such as the Kinect, Leep Motion and sensors, we will explore how to create various interfaces and systems that bridge the virtual and physical worlds. We will explore key concepts such as Input/Output, Interface, Interaction, etc. through course work, familiarizing students with digital tools and prototyping methods. This is an entry level computation class, no programming or hardware experience or prerequisites required. to be updated In a globalized media world that is bringing people together, countries still maintain their own media systems.  These systems are closely tied to government types, economic structures and culture norms and standards.  What are the differences and similarities between the worldÕs different media systems?  How does contemporary technology change the way that media systems function?  How do countries with different media systems work with each other to disseminate information? The Chinese have played a pivotal role in the dissemination of information to its citizens over time.  Currently, the Chinese read and watch news at a higher rate than any other country in the world.  This course will explore the evolution of mass media and communication in China over time. This course explores the inter-disciplinary field of computational social science, drawing from sociology, computer science, and related disciplines. Students will obtain skills to automate collection of social science data from new sources (Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.), to classify unstructured data into discrete variables and to analyze them using a combination of techniques that includes screen-scraping, natural language processing and machine learning. Complex ethical and legal issues that arise when working with these novel sources of data. Students develop their imagination about new questions that can be asked with these new data sources. Reading and reproducing exemplary studies produced by computational social scientists. Apple is currently the most valuable company/brand in the world. Despite its technological origin, the company has always valued design, interface, affect, imagination and creativity – skills that the humanities and the interpretive social sciences offer and promote. This course examines how cultural studies, in its analyses of fandom, reception theory, cultural hegemony, etc., provide students the theoretical skills to understand, analyze and prepare for working in the emerging creative industries in China today. Some topics we will explore in the course include: cultural industry and modernity, popular culture and everyday life, representations of gender and sexuality in advertisement, the impact of new social media and information technology, and censorship. to be updated to be updated This course introduces the theory, method, and practice of digital storytelling.  Students will learn to analyze digital storytelling in various media forms and modes of production, and evaluate the cultural impact of new media narratives. They will explore digital storytelling affordances including text, video, audio, design, animation, and interactivity. Students will gain hands-on experience developing digital narratives and creating digital critiques. No specific digital media authoring experience is required. to be updated This course explores the emergence and development of different communication media in a broad social and cultural context. From the ancient Asian typewriters to modern Social Networking Service (SNS), media operate in relation to particular social, economic, and technological conditions. This course will aid students in their efforts to make sense of how communications processes have mediated and shaped our interactions with each other as well as our understanding of the world. It does so by examining specific instances of media communications in a number of key cases observed in world history and by showing how technological innovation in media communications has led to new social, cultural, and political forms. to be updated to be updated This course will examine the global effects of media, the flow of information, the controls countries impose on communication systems and the effects of Western dominance on world media systems.  The course will introduce students to the key theories, concepts, and practices in the broadly defined international communication. Students will examine the giant media companies around the world and discuss the impact of ownership on media messages.  The course will look at how advertising, music and news programs affect more than their intended audiences, and look at how technology is changing the global media picture. Geographic Information Science, or GIS, is concerned with the scientific study of geographic information. This course offers an introduction to methods of describing, managing, and processing geographic information. We will explore the nature of geographic information, data models and structures for geographic information, geographic data input, data manipulation, spatial analytic and modeling techniques, and error analysis. This class is helpful for students wishing to apply GIS within numerous disciplines. to be updated to be updated The course explores key issues in the study of digital media from its beginning to very recent theoretical developments. Central themes of the course generally include: immediacy/hypermediacy, interactivity, cybernetics, im/materiality of media, network, posthumanism, biomedia, ubiquitous computing, and the recent hype in the independent media industry. Building upon theoretical works that range across a host of disciplines, including literary studies, communication studies, film and media, philosophy, and science studies, the course proposes the development of a critical analytical framework for approaching new media practices and theories. The goal is to analyze what makes new media ÒnewÓ by comparing them with earlier media practices, as well as to understand how the interactions among digital technologies, practices, and theories influence emerging and changing spheres of our society. The seminar also examines different forms of visual art and literature that lead and reflect the sociocultural paradigm shifts of digital technologies. Examines nature and role of public opinion from a comparative perspective, providing a broad-based introduction to the dynamics of citizens’ social and political attitudes. The goal of the course is to help students arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of forces that shape beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of the public, how those views are publicly expressed, and the influence of those opinions on policy outcomes. While the design, implementation, and analysis of public opinion surveys and election polls will be discussed, the course focuses on the substantive, and not the methodological aspects of public opinion. Does news affect us differently if we watch it on YouTube, on PerezHilton.com or on The Daily Show, or if we read it on The New York Times or as a blog post? Do we feel that certain kinds of news-cultural, political, satirical-is more important, or more informative? How did these differences play out in earlier news formats, like periodicals, pamphlets, or almanacs? This class will explore the visual culture of news from Early Modernity to the present by examining the formats and media it has adopted, the ways it designs the page/pamphlet/screen, how it incorporates images, and the relationship of all of this to what the news reports. Our goals in this class are to collectively explore the relationship between text, image, design, and medium. Focuses on how to extend statistical techniques learned in Stats 101 and how to apply already learned techniques to real-world social science-related problems. You will learn a) how to select an appropriate model for a given dataset b) how to interpret the diagnostic information from a statistical technique c) what types of social science problems are usually addressed with what kind of statistical model. Covered material includes standard linear model, generalized linear models, bootstrap methods, and additional linear models that rely on specific assumptions about the underlying data. Data in the World utilizes R software in applying models to real-world datasets, including for a final project that can serve as a basis for a signature work. In almost every field, there is a need to draw inference from or make decisions based on data. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to machine learning that is approachable to diverse disciplines and empowers students to become proficient in the foundational concepts and tools while working with interdisciplinary real-world data. You will learn to (a) structure a machine learning problem, (b) determine which algorithmic tools are applicable to a given problem, (c) apply those algorithmic tools to diverse, interdisciplinary data examples, (d) evaluate the performance of your solution, and (e) how to accurately interpret and communicate your results. This course is a fast-paced, applied introduction to machine learning that arms you with the basic skills you will need in practice to both conduct analyses and effectively communicate your results. Investigation of study designs collecting data and their implications for statistical inference. Design and analysis of surveys of populations, including stratification, clustering, multi-stage sampling, design-based inference, considerations when analyzing convenience samples and big data. Design and analysis of causal studies including randomized experiments, blocking, fractional factorial designs, non-randomized studies, propensity score analysis. Applications involving big data, health, policy, natural and social sciences. Use of computational techniques to operationalize basic concepts from economics. Expressive marketplaces: combinatorial auctions and exchanges, winner determination problem. Game theory: normal and extensive-form games, equilibrium notions, computing equilibria. Mechanism design: auction theory, automated mechanism design. to be updated to be updated Rapid technological change may imply that cities will dramatically change form as new technologies emerge, with important implications for urban design. Self-driving cars, the possibility of three-dimensional transportation networks, telecommuting, urban agriculture, green cities, etc. This course will explore implications of these developments for urban design in light of underlying sociological and economic forces at work. Introduction to urban and spatial economics. Neoclassical monocentric city spatial model, patterns of land values, property prices, residential density and impact of distressed communities on broader development. Systems of cities and regional growth, role of cities in economic development. United States urban features: ethical and socio-economic effects of housing segregation and implications for discrimination. Tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness in housing resource allocation. Business location theory, impact of innovations in transportation, and technology’s effect on work patterns. to be updated This course addresses the morality of respecting the natural world, including plants, animals and all forms of planetary life for their own sake. Is pollution of air and water wrong in itself, and not simply because it damages resources that present and future generations of human beings need? Does the suffering of nonhuman animals impose a moral claim upon human beings? Do all species have a claim to survive in the face of human development? Different philosophical theories as well as a variety of cultural traditions of thought about the environment will be studied and discussed. This course examines the international communityÕs responses to various global environmental problems. Because many environmental problems cross national borders, solutions require some form of global governance such as state-led mechanisms in the form of international environmental regimes. The course will thus explore how and why states both succeed and fail to negotiate international governance mechanisms. The course will also examine why some international environmental regimes are more effective than others and why states choose to comply with environmental regimes. The role of the environment in the theory and practice of economics. Topics include ways in which markets fail to efficiently allocate resources in the presence of pollution, along with the array of policies regulators used to correct those failures; the empirical techniques used by economists to put values on environmental commodities; and an examination of questions related to everyday environmental issues, particularly those confronting China, and the developing world. to be updated This course is an introduction to international political economy, the study of how and why international economic policies are formed, and how the international economy influences domestic politics and economic performance. Course will include a significant amount of economic theory. The approach of the course is a mix of history and current events. We will examine the development of the international political-economic order since the 18th century and simultaneously compare Òlessons from historyÓ to present-day issues. We will also consider the extent to which the current global order fundamentally differs from the previous period of globalization (1815-1914). Topics covered include: foreign trade, capital flows, foreign direct investment and multinational corporations, monetary policy and exchange rates, immigration, and international organizations such as the WTO and IMF. This course traces the histories of global exchange and explores how they intersect with various cultures of globalization in the present-day. This course analyzes how early exploration and colonial trade relate to global connections in the contemporary period. This course shows how historical and anthropological approaches have shed light on the importance of border-crossings and cross-cultural encounters in shaping social identities and differences; spatial cores and peripheries; and hierarchies and societal transformations. Attention to global encounters allows us to deepen our understanding of trade, civilization, state-building, labor, and global food chains. Together, these aspects of everyday life and social organization reveal the diversity and dynamism of globalization. This course explores the intersection of space and ethnicity through the myriad ways Chinatown has circulated as memory, fantasy, narrative, and myth in the dominant cultural imagination. Through this exploration, the course engages the lived realities of overseas Chinese communities, placing them in the broader context of Asian American history. It aims to show how changing conceptions of ÒChinesenessÓ have productively engaged with real Chinatowns from Japan to America, and the phantom Chinatowns of film and fiction. Employing multidisciplinary approaches including urban history, architecture and ethnography, the course reveals how the Chinatowns of myth and memory intersect with the lived reality of overseas Chinese communities. The course trains students to document and represent Durham past and present with digital media. Students learn how to digitize historical and cultural materials, research in archives and public records and present information through various forms including web pages, databases, maps, video and other media. In addition to producing digital representations of historical materials, students learn more broadly how to think about and analyze the social impact of new representations of place and space. to be updated to be updated What is a city? How do cities shape the everyday lives and experiences of those who live in them, as well as cultural conceptions of modernity and civilisation? Pairing texts drawn from literature and the interdisciplinary field of urban studies, this course will study how writers and thinkers have sought to express and analyse what it means to live in cities. By reading literary accounts of urban life such as Mu Shiying in Shanghai, James Joyce in Dublin, Michel de Certeau in New York, and Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul, alongside perspectives from urban planners and sociologists such as Liang Sicheng, Jane Jacobs, Saskia Sassen, and Spiro Kostof, you will engage with some of the most creative and influential ideas concerning the complex relationship between our cities and ourselves. Without paying attention to institutions, one cannot understand why some societies are wealthy and others poor; why some are innovative and others un-creative; or why some are politically stable and others in perpetual turmoil. As such, this course should be of direct interest to students of economic development, economic history, social inequality, and democratization, among other fields of social inquiry. The first half of the course delineates the subject and covers the social mechanisms that govern institutional transformations. Attention is paid to the pace of institutional transformations, latent change, social inertia, political revolutions, and links among beliefs and behaviors. The second half focuses on the social functions of institutions. Again, the emphasis is on pertinent analytical methodologies. The functions studied include: the control of free riding, credible commitment, redistribution, the provision of collective goods, coordination, protection of expectations, generation of common knowledge, governance, rent seeking, and the reduction of transaction costs. Since the late 19th century, Shanghai has emerged as the leading metropolis in China in many respects. It has served as the breeding grounds and model for the social, political, economic and cultural modernization, and urbanization of China over the century that followed. Through a combination of lectures, readings, film screenings, field trips, and research projects, this course explores the history of Shanghai and connects the colorful legacy of the treaty port era (1842-1943) with the re-emergence of Shanghai as a global metropolis since the 1990s. While focusing mainly on those two eras, which have been the subjects of the bulk of scholarship in the emerging field of ÒShanghai Studies,Ó we also examine the relatively neglected history of Shanghai prior to the 1840s, as well as the Mao Years of 1949-1976 when Shanghai became a bastion for the violent politics of the Cultural Revolution. Variations in the structure of inequality over time and across nations shape the way people behave, the interactions they have every day, and the challenges they will face across the life course. Inequality shapes and is shaped by educational institutions, economic development, work institutions, and state welfare programs. This course explores the nature, forms, and socioeconomic bases of inequality and social stratification. It pays particular attention to age, gender, race, ethnicity, class, region, and family as dimensions of inequality. The course pays particular attention to the degree to which people are able to change positions in the social structure over time. to be updated This course focuses on digital visualization and communication methods which can be used to represent and describe place and its changes. Through lectures, laboratory exercises, and experiential learning, students will learn a series of digital technologies, including ESRI ArcGIS, CartoDB, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, and MassGIS. Students will use these software programs to analyse, interpret, and present spatial and demographic patterns of different phenomena. The overarching goal of this course is to improve studentsÕ spatial reasoning abilities and to help them master data visualization and communication skills. This course investigates the dramatic urban transformation that has taken place in the past 30 years in China. The scale and speed of this transformation means that it has far-reaching consequences for China, Asia, and the world, influencing everything from poverty alleviation to food security. Understanding why and how China has urbanized — and how China poises to urbanize in the next three decades — is therefore of critical importance. This course covers various topics related to ChinaÕs urbanization, including rural-to-urban migration, urban inequality, real estate development and land market, as well as urban governance. Students will learn how to develop annotated bibliography and write a well-reasoned essay about one or more topics related to ChinaÕs urbanization. to be updated Minorities and low-income households bear a disproportionate burden from environmental pollution. The inequality may happen in many countries, cultures and contexts. This course examines ways in which environmental injustices in the USA, China and in the world may arise out of discriminatory behavior and/or market forces founded on individual, firm, and government incentives. The course also analyses policies that are aimed at providing fair treatment and equal protection from pollution regardless of race, color, or income. The course first sets the theoretical framework used to document and explain disproportionate exposures. Based on this foundation, students then review existing empirical evidence through case studies and evaluate competing explanations of sources of injustice. The objective of this course is to enable students to examine environmental justice issues using an economics framework, which provides a different perspective for evaluating policies to address environmental inequities observed in todayÕs world. This course considers a variety of literary texts from the perspective of the nexus of cultures and societies in Asia. It emphasizes critical, transnational and interdisciplinary perspectives on two or more Asian cultures and their interactions in the world. In addition to providing the critical theoretical tools to analyze the production and reception of inter-Asian texts, the course will cover a representative variety of texts including history, literature, current affairs, cinematic, visual, and pop-cultures. By framing these texts in their local, regional, and global contexts, a comprehensive critical analysis will be developed. Is every-body either male or female? Does the body precede being female or male, black or white, gay or straight? Has the body always been so throughout history? This seminar will use interdisciplinary and cross-cultural lenses to examine gender, one of the most important aspects by which our bodies are categorized. We will consider the contestation of ÒgenderÓ in the context of decolonial critique and conservative Òanti-GenderÓ backlash; and will read a wide range of texts on questions such as embodiment, medicine, historiography, trans debate, and performativity. This course examines the current scholarship on the anthropology and interdisciplinary study of global migration, and the ethical predicaments at center of contemporary forms of human mobility. Students will consider the particularities of migratory experiences in different regions of the world, and the different types of local, national, and global moral economies that emerge in these different places and histories.  Particular attention will be focused on the political questions that arise when human compassion runs into conflict with the desire to preserve the cultural integrity of one’s national identity. The course will draw on ethnographic texts, legal and policy materials, biographies, literature, film, and artistic responses to contemporary migration and refugee crises. The course explores the culture, politics and process of globalization in light of the responses, ideologies, and practices of the anti-globalization movement. We will focus on the interrelationship between the analysis of globalization and policy formulation on such topics as social justice, radical environmentalism, animal rights, labor, migration, poverty, natural resource management, religion and citizenship. Special attention will be focused on the role of social media, film, and photography in anti- and alternative globalization movements. Case studies from the United States, Latin America, South and East Asia, Africa, and Europe will be explored. Course examines monetary/financial crises plaguing the world since the 16th century. Analyzes origin, unfolding, and impact of crises, debates generated by them, and formulation/implementation of policy measures. Attention is paid to international implications/connections on European/Asian money supply, banking/credit systems; reaction to South Sea Bubble and John Law Credit Systems in numerous European nations; experiments with paper money in America; rise/demise of gold standard in 19th/20th century; currency and exchange rate problems of last three decades. Case studies will be selected and assigned according to participants’ interests. The regulation of labor immigration is among the most important and controversial public policy issues in high-income countries, but these issues have implications for understanding the social, political, and economic structures of all nations. Many countries in Europe and North America, including the UK and the US, have experienced very rapid increase in labor immigration over the past 20 years. In China, immigration, return migration, and internal migration have shaped much of its development. This course attempts to understand the determinants of immigration and how nations approach this critical social issue. Analysis of the determinants of international capital movements, trade imbalances, and nominal and real exchange rates. Policy debates such as the foreign indebtedness of the United States, emerging market debt crises, exchange-rate-based inflation stabilization, and balance-of-payment crises. This course introduces the major episodes and patterns in the history of human migration over the last millennium. It examines how mobile people have shaped various institutions and cultural forms which illuminate global structures of power and inequality. Students will learn the relationship between migration and race, class, gender, citizenship, colonialism, nation, nationalism, political movements, trade, religion, and labor. The course uses sociological, anthropological and political theories for historical analysis of migration patterns and the social position of migrants. Topics include Indian Ocean trade networks, pilgrimage, Atlantic slave trade, mobility and colonial state building processes, and trans-national political movements. This course provides students with an understanding of research designs and research methods used in the social sciences. Students will learn about the scientific method, research methods and design, measurement, and ethical issues. Topics include quantitative and qualitative approaches, as well as mixed methods. This is an advanced course on social science approaches to the study of China. We will read social science research from a range of disciplines such as Geography, Anthropology, and Sociology. We will study how social science research informs our understandings of China, and how China challenges existing social science paradigms. We will cover issues that are particularly salient in the field of China studies, including the dynamics between the rural and the urban, theories of ÒguanxiÓ (social exchange), etc. Finally, we will add a comparative dimension by bringing in scholarly works that focus on other socialist and post-socialist countries such as Romania and Russia. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Cultures and Movements. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines. The seminar will foster the ability to see their disciplinary knowledge from a wider perspective and to apply it flexibly. Specific topics will vary. This seminar is required for all juniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor.

This seminar is required for all seniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor. This course focuses on the culture and politics of social movements, interest groups, NGOs, and collective protest activity. This course explores theoretical approaches to understand the organizational, tactical, and affective dimensions of social discontent, resistance, collective action, and protest. It will also examine histories of direct action such as public provocation and moral shock, occupation of buildings and sit-ins, marches and street blocking, performance and Òart-activismÓ. The students will be required to select and conduct an independent research project. Possible examples: Black Lives Matters, the Tea-Party, Òwhite rageÓ and the election of Donald Trump, neo-fascist movements in Europe and elsewhere, the Arab Spring, environmental protest movements, labor activism, and suicide as a form of protest. This course is about how some people get ahead and have income, wealth, and power while others stay poor. People generally agree that having some wealth is better than having none, but wealth Ð and the processes that create wealth Ð are perhaps more important than we usually acknowledge. In the course, we will distinguish wealth (ownership of houses, savings, and investments) from income (wages and salaries) and discuss why this difference matters. We will discuss how wealth, income, and other material benefits are distributed across people and families. Then we will spend the bulk of the semester exploring the origins and consequences of wealth ownership and inequality. The course provides a critical overview to the anthropology and ethnography of contemporary China. Beginning with the emergence of ethnology in China in the 1920s and 1930s, students will be introduced to some of the key figures in the pre-revolutionary period of China, and the key concepts, theories, and frameworks that emerged during this period in dialogue both with Soviet and British anthropology. The course then turns to the socialist period, and considers early Maoist approaches to the social sciences, and the state project to identify and classify ChinaÕs minority nationalities in the 1950s. The post- Mao reform era (1978 to the present) witnesses the globalization of China and the flourishing of a wide range of new kinds of ethnographic projects. This section of the course will pay particular attention to issues of transformations in class, gender, and ethnicity, the study of rural to urban migration, the anthropology of ChinaÕs urbanization, environmentalism, commodification and consumption, and the study of development in ChinaÕs ethnic border regions. This course takes students on a journey into the worlds of gender, labor, and mobility as they intersect in dynamic and intimate ways. Topics include: exploration the concept of gender by using anthropological and sociological theories; examination of foundational concepts in political economy, including the state, the family firm, class, labor, migration and accumulation; ethnographic case studies on factory labor, housework, sex work, the service industry and IT work across Asia, Europe, and North America; analyzing how historical and contemporary pressures of industrialization, urbanization, uneven development, and information technology challenge our assumptions about gendered labor and migration; how care work, domestic labor, intimacy, and affect do not fit singularly into cultural categories of feminine versus masculine; public versus private; or individual versus collective domains. This course explores the history and practice of ethnographic field research and engages central debates about ethnographic method. The readings prompt deeper reflection on doing field research, and challenges students to think about anthropological ways of knowing. Students will be required to carry out field research, define and design a project, recording (through field notes or other methods) every step of the way. This is thus a writing- and field research-intensive course. It is organized into several practical componentsÑconstituting Òthe field,Ó participant-observation (Òdeep hanging outÓ), interviewing, and writing up findings. Students will get the chance to put several key methods into practice Ñanalyzing spaces, collecting life histories, doing semi-structured interviews and conducting participant-observation. Students will also have the option to experiment with other methods of collecting data, including the use of photography or digital video. This course is an anthropological examination of ‘new media’ – their varied forms and histories, how they are used and understood, and their meanings and effects within different communities of users. We will chart a number of technologies deemed ‘new’ in their day and the social meanings and communities that such technologies generated. We will also explore new media in domains of art and literature, as well as issues of race, gender, sexuality and how other indices of difference come to bear on new media and its use. Most course material will be drawn from anthropology, but will also draw on media studies, visual studies, cultural studies and critical theory, queer and gender theory, history and geography. Students will make use of the Duke library resource page for this class: http://guides.library.duke.edu/new_media. This course explores the intersection of neoliberalism, development and humanitarianism, largely from the perspective of cultural anthropology and the social studies of development. We often think of development as the betterment of mankind and as overall progress. Personal, economic, or otherwise, we tend to view development as a positive process. This course is meant to question widespread assumptions about development. How has development become a discourse and a practice of power since the 1940s? Why do many observers see development as a neocolonial phenomenon? Is development mitigating the domination of the Òfirst worldÓ on the Òthird world,Ó or is it contributing to it? How have development agencies evolved and responded to critiques over time? We will pay close attention to the social relations that constitute and inform the relations, rights and obligations that exist between wealthy and the poor, including China, the US, and many other countries. This course takes up the vexed issue of economic development in Africa Ð its failures and its successes Ð from the early colonial period to the present, focusing especially on the transition from the 1960s ÒmodernizingÓ moment to the Millennium projects and the humanitarian aid of the present. We will read the works of development experts, World Bank executives, anthropologists and historians, exploring the challenges of these projects and what might be done in the future. Illness and healing fundamentally shape our sense of the boundaries between nature and culture, life and death, mind and body, self and environment, and human and machine.  The central goal of this course is to examine where, how, and why we encounter, challenge, bridge, or sustain these divisions. To pursue this goal, we examine the cultural, social, and political dimensions of biomedicine globally and cross-culturally.  We study ethnographic writing as unique methodological and theoretical inroads into these perspectives.  Our discussions will draw on both scholarly and popular cultural accounts of the experiential and interpretive aspects of medicine.  Course readings introduce you to key concepts in critical medical anthropology, and trace health, illness, and biomedicine through gender, sexuality and race. This subject explores the precarious balance between the ideal of democracy and histories of authoritarianism in Latin America. Using case studies from different historical contexts, the class examines continuities and ruptures in Latin American political history, and the cultural contexts in which populisms of the left or right, and authoritarian regimes, emerge or recede. This subject encourages students to consider political theory in relation to historical and cultural specificity. Key questions addressed include; what political cultures are associated with democratic, authoritarian and populist forms of rule? What role do struggles over memories of authoritarian pasts play in contemporary democracies? How do democracies evolve into dictatorships, and dictatorships into democracies?Previous study of international relations is helpful, but not required. This subject explores the precarious balance between the ideal of democracy and histories of authoritarianism in Latin America. Using case studies from different historical contexts, the class examines continuities and ruptures in Latin American political history, and the cultural contexts in which populisms of the left or right, and authoritarian regimes, emerge or recede.

Ethnic groups in China can be found in both remote border regions and metropolitan areas. None of them live in complete isolation, or in ÒprimitiveÓ society. On the contrary, most of them have always lived in conditions of diversity through interactions with neighboring groups, dominant ethnic groups as well as various states. This course will explore the intersections of ethnicity, religion, gender, health, media and politics through case studies of ethnic peoples in both ChinaÕs borders and cities. Highlighting how and why people construct and cross boundaries, this course sheds new light on being a global citizen. Demography is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with sociology, economics, population health, statistics, and mathematics. The population issues, such as aging, population decline, fertility, and migration, also associate with economic development and policy making in different countries. This course will review key population problems in contemporary industrialized and developing societies. The following issues can be discussed in the course: the end of population growth, population aging, mortality in developed and developing countries, migration, and urbanization. This course explores diasporic cultures across Asia, Africa, and the Americas from historical and anthropological perspectives. We begin by exploring the rise of Chinatowns across the world, with an emphasis on the Chinese-American experience, particularly during the U.S. Civil Rights period. We then examine how transnational migration has historically shaped the worlds of indentured labor, colonial trade, and hybrid food cultures. From narratives of turtle soup and beer to the personal accounts of female Chinese scholars, African traders, and coolie laborers, we examine how stories of transnational mobility color our understandings of migration, race, gender, and global connection. What is the Middle East and how can we understand its diverse ethnic and religious groups from a political perspective? To answer these questions, this course will explore the topics of knowledge production, Orientalism, ethnicity, religion, and gender with ethnographic research conducted in the region. The Middle East has largely been mistaken as a homogeneous and timeless place. We will examine how diverse and dynamic the region is and how national politics (often with Western intervention) has empowered or marginalized certain ethnic and religious groups in such countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel. This course will explore the home as a site of attachment, the house as a place that emerged from social relationships, and housing an infrastructure whose construction is shaped by politico-economic forces. The interrelationship between the home, the house, and housing will be discussed. The course will cover contemporary issues of housing such as gentrification, segregation, and eviction. The course will provide broader and deeper understandings of the meanings of home and our relationship to the built environment. This course introduces the key concepts and debates within Cultural Anthropology with topics such as racism and essentialism, kinship, gender and sexuality, globalization, etc. In an age where debates addressing migration, robotics, genetic engineering, and ecological crises abound, questions about how humanity is experienced and defined have become more pertinent than ever before. Explores the food system through fieldwork, study, and guest lectures that include farmers, nutritionists, sustainable agriculture advocates, rural organizers, and farmworker activists. Examines how food is produced, seeks to identify and understand its workers and working conditions in fields and factories, and, using documentary research conducted in the field and other means, unpacks the major current issues in the food justice arena globally and locally. Fieldwork required, but no advanced technological experience necessary. At least one group field trip, perhaps to a local farm or farmers market, required. The refugee is caught between national and international political logics. Each country applies its own calculus for deciding which asylum seekers should be granted the status of refugee, and how refugees should be accommodated or denied access to public goods, rights and residency. This course examines the politics of national responses to record numbers of people seeking asylum, including bureaucracies of (in)validation, xenophobia, the construction of walls and detention centres, international accords, multicultural solidarity, and novel categories of citizenship. Contemporary responses to refugees reveal the interconnectedness of political and structural violence, the limits of humanitarianism and hope for new forms of international cooperation.

This course introduces students to the study of sound and sonic environments in urban spaces.  Students will learn about theoretical approaches that approach sound and sonic landscapes as socially cultivated and study listening as a cultural practice. This course includes study of sound and music from different traditions around the world, recorded soundscapes (films, games, installations), built and ecological environments (parks, subways, streets, institutions, clubs, neighborhoods), the politics of making sound, and the history and use of sound technology (sound production, reproduction, reception, acoustic materials). This course introduces students to the study of noise in relation to public life, the representation of public life in sound, the shaping of city living practices by its acoustic architecture, and creative responses of sound in urban activist projects.  Students in this course will conduct their own fieldwork on urban soundscapes. Bandits and outlaws have historically played a unique role in popular imagination. In the Chinese classic Water Margin, outlaws flee tyrannical administrators but eventually make their peace with the emperor. Robin Hood occupies an equally ambivalent position between outlaw and elite roles. Seventeenth and 18th-century Atlantic pirates were feared, but their ships are viewed by scholars as laboratories for democratic experiment. Pirates, bandits and insurgents often occupy similar marginal spaces between illegality and social legitimacy today. This course will study this ambiguous status, through historical cases and ending with banditry and border violence in Central Africa and in North America. This course exposes students to major classical and modern social theorists from the Enlightenment to the present. The course pays particular attention to theories seeking to follow models of the natural sciences and those seeking a more critical and interpretive understanding of modern society. Topics also include examining how sociological theory relates to other modern currents, such as conservatism, socialism, existentialism, anti-colonialism, feminism, post-modernism. This course introduces you to the world of sociology. Sociologists study the social relationships, social interactions, and the influence of structural forces upon us. In this course, students will be exposed to various concepts and theories to address the sociological questions. This course is a broad survey course covering a wide variety of sociological topics. The course will focus on the relationship between individual and society, important social institutions in our society, and various social inequalities. The terms ÒcultureÓ and ÒculturalÓ have a wide range of meanings: objects, genres, actions (especially conventional), mental representations, and even complex institutional structures are all part of culture. Many sociologists argue that culture is not its object, rather it is an approach; it is about shared meaning and permeates all of social life. This course will allow students to engage in and contribute to this conversation in an effort to develop their understanding of culture and related changes in social processes over time. This course exposes students to the unique approaches the sociologists take to understanding culture and introduces them to many of the major theorists of culture. By the end of the course, students will have a basic toolkit for understanding society culturally. Social problems both reflect and generate social change; this course provides a comparative analysis of the major social problems that have propelled social and cultural dynamics across historical periods, nations, and social groups by gender, race/ethnicity, and social class. The course explores the origins and implications of deviant behavior, social conflict and inequality, human progress and social change. Because studying social problems often involves specialize research methods, this course also investigates issues such as the unique inductive and deductive processes and related analysis methods that have developed in this field. This course is an exploration of the changing and contrasting perceptions of social, themselves, and the natural world that people develop. It investigates how our perceptions are conditioned by the times we live in and reigning assumptions of our societies. The course covers a range of related topics including the exploration of perceptions of the self through the arts and the examination of conflicts between science and society. Sociologists and social psychologists have made significant strides in recent decades using mathematical models to describe how people import cultural meanings into social interactions. This course explains how people maintain identities in role relationships and group interactions, and it explores a theory of how people perform normal institutional roles, respond to odd situations, and try to feel good about themselves. Students will learn to use computer simulations to model self, identity and emotional processes. They will leave the course knowing how to think scientifically about routine and unexpected parts of everyday life. Research and theories on gender issues in the organization of work are central to inquiry across the social sciences and in sociology, in particular. The socio-historical causes of gender segregation in the workplace and the contemporary consequences for wages and occupational status have permeated research and have been central to policy discussions as well. This course studies how gender interacts with work and complex organizations such as businesses, not-for-profits, and government agencies. It looks at how women have changed their roles in many societies and asks why progress has been slower in others. It uses case studies of specific work organizations with gender-related problems in group projects and presentations. Hannah Arendt is one of the most important 20th century western political thinker. Although her work covered a wide range of subjects, her foremost concern was politics and society. This course aims to familiarize students with the political and social thought of Hannah Arendt, so that they may use her ideas to understand and address the 21st centuryÕs pressing problems. We will read from her seminal works, as well as secondary scholarship, in order to understand ArendtÕs key concepts Ð which could include thoughtlessness, the banality of evil, totalitarianism, the political, statelessness, revolution, power, authority, and labor and work. We will then apply these concepts to some of todayÕs pressing social and political problems. Hannah Arendt is one of the most important 20th century western political thinker.

This course explores the process of family transformation in contemporary East Asia and the U.S. from a comparative perspective. It introduces different concepts, theories, and frameworks to explain the slow but noticeable family changes in East Asian societies and some distinct characteristics in the US. It will draw literature from sociology, demography, anthropology, and economics to study love, passion, marriage, cohabitation, mate selection, same-sex couples, and divorce across social contexts. Race, ethnicity, and citizenship structure interactions and social change in all countries, and they also condition the forms of interaction that determine global processes and well-being. This course provides a critical framework to access origins, manifestations and evolution of race, ethnicity and citizenship. The course reviews and addresses the origins of and theoretical orientations of race, ethnicity and citizenship as constructs with social and political implications. It examines different ethnographies as well as quantitative studies to pinpoint how social scientists actually examine and draws conclusions about race, ethnicity and citizenship. This course offers an introduction to theories, methods and approaches to historical inquiry and research including the use of archives, the interpretation of visual and textual documents, and the recording of oral histories. Students will be exposed to both the humanist and the social scientific approaches to historical research, as well as broader theoretical questions of history and historiography. As such, students learn what is history, how is it made, and what constitutes valid scholarly approaches to historiography.  Students will apply their learning by conducting original historical research on a topic of their own choosing and writing a research paper. Southeast Asia, located at the center of the seaborne Silk Road, is one of the great global crossroads of economic and cultural exchange. For two thousand years itÕs been a magnet for merchants, missionaries, pilgrims, adventurers, and mercenaries from India and China, the Middle East, and eventually from Europe. Globalization is sometimes thought to be a feature of modernity, but in Southeast Asia global cultures have been mixing for millennia. This course begins with the peopling of Southeast Asia, the rise of global trading entrepot, and concludes in the 16th C. with the dawn of European colonization. This course explores the nature of historical change and continuity between the pre-modern era and our current era of global connectivity, taking students from ancient roots to global routes. Instead of a chronological survey, the focus is on broad subjects that cut across fields, regions, and periods.  Students will have multiple opportunities to apply historical and interdisciplinary methods of research and analysis to investigate the formation and development of particular global issues, and compare historical and contemporary perspectives on these issues.  Topics will vary by term and instructor. The Indian Ocean world encompasses a vast geographical area from the East African coasts to the islands of South China Sea. As the oldest site of ÒglobalizationÓ, people and commodities moving across this ocean had played key roles in the spread of religion, highroads of commerce, and geo-politics of empire. Taking the period between 2500BCE and 1900CE as our point of reference we will study, the various approaches employed by historians towards writing the history of the Indian Ocean world. We will learn the various ways of thinking of Indian Ocean as a region and to periodize it. Peoples of South Asia have produced one of the oldest and ever evolving cultures of the world. This course will survey the history of the region from the earliest times to the eve of European conquest. We will learn the historical development of various religious traditions, the state formation processes, and the socio-political institutions that are foundational to South Asian history. In tracing the development of agrarian and urban societies, economic and ecological transformations, formation of various ethnic/religious/linguistic identities and inequalities, we will pay special attention to South AsiaÕs interactions with the wider world. This course offers a survey of the history of the world, by which is meant a historical overview of major processes and interactions in the development of human society since its early development some 60,000 years ago, going beyond the fundamental questions and concerns of area studies (such as East Asian studies, South Asian studies). In explaining the large scale processes such as empire building, commerce and religious practices, this course will show how various forms of human interactions, especially migration played a key role. This course will provide deep historical understanding for some of the pressing issues of the contemporary world such as migration, globalization, and imperialism. This course takes a comparative historical approach to contemporary global issues in various temporal and geographical contexts. Students will focus on issues that emerged in the modern era and may include such topics as terrorism and national security, environmental protection and degradation, resource distribution and trade, health and welfare, and cultural and religious diversity.  Students explore the nature of historical change and continuity and will apply historical methods of research and analysis as they investigate the formation and development of particular global issues. The specific case studies and themes in the course will vary by term and instructor. Before the Industrial Revolution, the global economy was driven by spices, and other rare and exotic commodities, many sourced from Asia. The global competition to acquire and monopolize spicesÑ the ÒSpice RaceÓÑ was a great engine for world history and economic development from c. 1250-1800. It made ÒspiceriesÓ, like Southeast Asia, centers of global trade and cultural exchange. This trade expanded the power of Asia states; drove European exploration; inspired scientific research; and became a key driver for the European colonization of Asia, and the world. The ÒSpice RaceÓ provides a fascinating lens on our modern economic and political order. This course takes a comparative historical approach to contemporary global issues in various temporal and geographical contexts. Students will focus on issues that emerged in the modern era and may include such topics as terrorism and national security, environmental protection and degradation, resource distribution and trade, health and welfare, and cultural and religious diversity.  Students explore the nature of historical change and continuity and will apply historical methods of research and analysis as they investigate the formation and development of particular global issues. The specific case studies and themes in the course will vary by term and instructor. Asia as the largest continent of the world comprises of 30 percent of worldÕs land surface and 60 percent of the worldÕs population. But what are the parameters for understanding Asia as a unified, identifiable place? Was there ever an Asian identity in history? Is this identity cultural, economic, political or a mix of all three? Since, all identities are formed in relation to other identities, was an Asian identity formed in reaction to other forms of existing identities in the world? Taking the period between 500 CE and 1950CE as the point of reference, this course exams the above questions in reaching an understanding of what are the various ways and the various historical moments in which we can think of Asia as a shared space amongst an extremely diverse population. Moreover, the course will discuss whether the historical processes that went into the creation of Asian identities were world historical in nature, or in other words, whether these processes had any effect in shaping the histories of societies both within Asia and outside of Asia. This course will aim at developing skills to evaluate to what extent we are ÒAsian,Ó ÒglobalÓ or otherwise and provide a foundational knowledge to interact with people and institutions within Asia and then the world. Seaborne trade linked the port cities of the Indian Ocean World and Southeast Asia to each other and the world beginning as early as 200BCE. Our class will examine the rise and fall of Asia and AfricaÕs coastal trading cities; the transcultural character of Indian Ocean trading entrepot; the life of merchants; labor migration; and cultural and religious exchange. Student will explore ancient and modern networks of interconnections through group projects on one or more of the global commodities that animated Asian trade, such as silk, slavery, cinnamon, opium, rubber, prostitution, nutmeg, palm oil, birdÕs nests, black pepper, etc. History is told from the perspective of nation-states and their people. This class reverses this practice, asking: ÒWhat does history look like from an outsiderÕs perspective?Ó Asia is home to 2,500,000 square kilometers of mostly interconnected mountain lands.  The upland people living there have long been outside of state control. On the opposite spectrum are boat-dwelling sea-nomads who rarely set foot on land, and follow migrating sea life across national boundaries. How do sea and mountain people understand history? Their own? And the nations around them? Our class will introduce and utilize ethnographic approaches to historical study and analysis. Central to Mohandas Karamchand GandhiÕs thought and activism was the principle of Òmoral force.Ó It formed the basis of his unique method of activism, satyagraha (quest for truth), his concept of non-violence, his life-style choices including vegetarianism, his idea of religion and politics, state-building and economics. This course explores the various meanings of the Òmoral forceÓ in Gandhian thought and examines its salience within the history of the political milieu Ð especially, anti-colonial movements in India that he belonged to. This course also discusses the legacies of Gandhi and the relevance of his Òmoral forceÓ for the twenty-first century world. What is the profile of the worker of the world? Though there are sophisticated social histories of the Global South, the overwhelming majority of works in labor history dwells on the figure of a white, male, free, waged worker of the Global North. This course challenges such a myopic conceptualization of the worker. Taking the world between 1700 CE and 2000 CE as the point of reference, it examines interdisciplinary approaches to study the social history of work and workers. It presents a far more diverse figure of the worker, and her/his subjectivity through the lens of a global understanding of institutions of control and oppression such as commerce, gender and race. This course aims to introduce students to the Islamic tradition of political thought through the careful study of selected foundational political texts of Islamic civilization. Students will be exposed to the great variety of thinking about politics that has taken place in the Islamic world through close readings and in-depth discussions of specific primary texts, including the QurÕan, the writings of Muslim philosophers, theologians, historians, and literary writers in the Middle Ages. Students will be introduced to such fundamental themes as: politics and religion, the individual and the political order, wisdom and political rule, power and conquest, tradition and modernity.  By establishing familiarity with the intellectual background of Muslim societies, this course fosters studentsÕ abilities to navigate an increasingly globalized world and to engage with actors from industry, government, and civil society with culturally and religiously diverse backgrounds. South Asia, the most populous part of the world, also boasts of the most diverse population.  We will learn the history of modern South Asia through an exploration of South Asian society in under British colonial rule and the problems of South AsiaÕs post-coloniality. Topics will include colonial extraction, racism, communal warfare, casteism, anti-colonial struggles, trade unionism, womenÕs movements and anti-caste movements. Finally, keeping in mind that people did not form any monolithic category, we will study the varying nature of peopleÕs identities and resistances, and their position in the imperial formation and the nation state. This course will survey the history of one of the greatest empires in Indian history, the Mughal empire through the lens of European travel writing between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries. Some of the questions we will explore are: How are European travelogues important sources for studying Indian history? Is European perspective on Indian society monolithic or is there a variety of European perspectives? Apart from introducing basic history of Mughal India, the course will explore themes such as early Orientalism and the history of the early modern world. Pan-Africanism began as an idea among ex-slaves and antislavery reformers in America, who believed that Africans and people of African descent across the world had common histories, common experiences, and common struggles against various forms of racism and marginalization. Pan-Africanism, which meant different things to different people, would go on to influence numerous intellectuals and social movements, from Negritude poets to African/Caribbean Independence and the American Civil Rights Movement. This course would survey the growth of this idea in a variety of facets, by looking at is influence upon history-writing, philosophy, poetry, political thought and social movements. What is science? Who has the authority to determine what qualifies as science? Is all scientific knowledge inherently political? This class will focus on the human dimensions of science. We will examine a number of topics, including Social Darwinism and contemporary global climate change discourse. Drawing from recent scholarship in the history of science, the class will explore debates about the meaning and origins of scientific modernity. Did Òmodern scienceÓ originate in the ÒWestÓ before diffusing elsewhere? We will also focus on questions of identity and representation in the making of scientific cultures. This course examines the upheaval of the 1914-18 war in a global perspective.  The course deals with the origins, conduct and consequences of war in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and on the revolution of violence that occurred during the war and which spilled over to the post-war years 1918-23.  Topics may include social and cultural trends alongside military encounters and diplomatic developments that transformed the world. Bandits and outlaws have historically played a unique role in popular imagination. In the Chinese classic Water Margin, outlaws flee tyrannical administrators but eventually make their peace with the emperor. Robin Hood occupies an equally ambivalent position between outlaw and elite roles. Seventeenth and 18th-century Atlantic pirates were feared, but their ships are viewed by scholars as laboratories for democratic experiment. Pirates, bandits and insurgents often occupy similar marginal spaces between illegality and social legitimacy today. This course will study this ambiguous status, through historical cases and ending with banditry and border violence in Central Africa and in North America. This course offers a study of global history using food as a central focus.  The course will center on a series of meals as case studies to examine broader themes, such as human environmental modification and exchange, the role of trade and migration in human history, the powerful influence of identity, and the gendered nature of labor roles in food production and preparation.  Students will focus on these themes in various regional and national contexts to identify global patterns in the development of food cultures, and to engage in comparative analyses. This course examines the literary and visual representations of war and mass violence in comparative and historical perspective.  Remembering war means remembering suffering and death, and discourses of mourning during and after war come in many forms.  Students will identify how war generates complex and divergent narratives that shape collective memories of mass violence in the past and influence the use of militarized violence in the present.

An introduction to the study of environmental sciences and policy through exploration of basic environmental principles in the life, physical, and social sciences. Emphasis on understanding how the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere function, and how these spheres interact with human consumption, production, and technological patterns and processes. The course includes field trips to local sites as relevant. Introduction to the dynamic processes that shape the Earth, the oceans, and the environment and their impact upon society. Earth science topics might include volcanoes, earthquakes, seafloor spreading, floods, landslides, groundwater, seashores and geohazards. Ocean sciences topics might include seafloor evolution, marine hazards, ocean currents and climate, waves and beach erosion, tides, hurricanes/cyclones, marine life and ecosystems, and marine resources. Emphasis on the formulation and testing of hypotheses, quantitative assessment of data, and technological developments that lead to understanding of the biosphere dynamics and associated current and future societal issues. An examination of the interactions between the natural and the social systems as they relate to the environment.  Focuses on ecological and earth system cycles, processes, and fundamental relationships, the environmental impact of human-induced change at the local, regional, and global levels.  The role of technology and the policy process in determining how environmental problems evolve are addressed.  Students will make use of ethical analysis to evaluate environmental tradeoffs, use case studies to integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives on environmental problems and to address issues of environmental justice. Minorities and low-income households bear a disproportionate burden from environmental pollution. The inequality may happen in many countries, cultures and contexts. This course examines ways in which environmental injustices in the USA, China and in the world may arise out of discriminatory behavior and/or market forces founded on individual, firm, and government incentives. The course also analyses policies that are aimed at providing fair treatment and equal protection from pollution regardless of race, color, or income. The course first sets the theoretical framework used to document and explain disproportionate exposures. Based on this foundation, students then review existing empirical evidence through case studies and evaluate competing explanations of sources of injustice. The objective of this course is to enable students to examine environmental justice issues using an economics framework, which provides a different perspective for evaluating policies to address environmental inequities observed in todayÕs world. The role of the environment in the theory and practice of economics. Topics include ways in which markets fail to efficiently allocate resources in the presence of pollution, along with the array of policies regulators used to correct those failures; the empirical techniques used by economists to put values on environmental commodities; and an examination of questions related to everyday environmental issues, particularly those confronting China, and the developing world. An overview of biological diversity, its patterns, and the current extinction crisis. Historical and theoretical foundations of conservation, from human values and law to criteria and frameworks for setting conservation priorities; island biogeography theory, landscape ecology, and socioeconomic considerations in reserve design; management of endangered species in the wild and in captivity; managing protected areas for long term viability of populations; the role of the landscape matrix around protected areas; and techniques for conserving biological diversity in semi-wild productive ecosystems such as forests. Human activities are fundamentally altering our landscapes and our atmosphere. The science of ecology is central to our ability to sustain populations of organisms, regional and global biodiversity, and the provision of critical ecosystem services. Fundamental principles of ecology, from population to ecosystem levels, will be examined. Course emphasizes critical analysis of ecological data and the design and interpretation of ecological experiments and models. Biogeochemistry is the study of how chemical elements flow through living systems and their physical environments. This course will investigate the factors that influence the cycling of those elements that are essential to life as well as the liberation, transport and exposure pathways of toxic trace elements. Concepts of nutrient limitation, element stoichiometry, primary productivity and carbon sequestration will be covered in depth, and will be applied to the study of human impacts on the global biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nutrients and trace metals. This course examines how plants sense and react to environmental change in both an organismal and evolutionary context and how those reactions are scaled to the specific change. The environmental changes examined include light, temperature, water, CO2, and nutrient availability. To examine these changes at the molecular level, a detailed review of plant development, growth, and physiology is also covered. This course is designed to provide the student with an understanding of the fundamentals of aqueous geochemistry. This course focuses on the fundamental aquatic geochemical processes (e.g. mineral precipitation/dissolution, solution complexation, acid-base chemistry) that shape and transform the Earth’s surface as a result of rock-water interactions, and associated impacts on the fate and transport of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous and geochemical environments. Topics to be covered include the chemical composition of soils, geochemical specalation, mineral weathering and stability, sorption and ion exchange, soil redox processes, chemical kinetics at environmental surfaces, and the nature, composition, structure, and properties of pollutants coupled with the major chemical mechanisms controlling the occurrence and mobility of chemicals in the environment. The rapid change in EarthÕs climate has distinct biological causes and effects and in this course, both will be addressed. Beginning with a review of the EarthÕs climate system and how it has evolved over time to its current state, students will then examine the human-driven causes of its rapid CO2 and temperature changes. These changes have consequences and detailed examinations of examples such as species range shifts, extinctions, and changes in biological event timing will be discussed. Ecosystem services are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems and utilizes a system level approach to examine the interactions between four services. The course will include discussion of nutrient recycling as a supporting service, food production as a provisioning service, carbon sequestration as a regulating service and education as a cultural service as well as how they fit together in a sustainable system. Students will learn through case studies of the application of conservation, restoration and market valuation approaches to protecting critical ecosystem processes. Introduces major concepts in eukaryotic cell biology with a focus on molecular biology. A major emphasis is placed on transcription, translation, protein targeting and transport. In addition, the structure and function of organelles and how they function in metabolism and energetics will be examined. The role of the cytoskeleton and extra cellular matrix in governing cell shape and motility will be addressed as well as the genetic regulation of DNA replication and its place in the cell cycle and how disruption of either can lead to cancer. The laboratory portion of the class would introduce common laboratory molecular biology techniques like DNA isolation, PCR, cloning, sequencing, immunocytochemistry and fluorescent microscopy. An overview of the fate and effects of chemicals in the environment. Topics include chemical characterization of pollutants, chemistry of natural waters, soil sediment chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, transfers between and transformations within environmental compartments, toxicokinetics, cellular metabolism, biological levels of organization, and approaches for assessing chemical hazards. Incorporates case studies focused on human health and ecosystem protection. This course examines the movement of food energy through a community and ecosystem. After examining species diversity and abundance in ecosystems, the course will look at the species interactions within that ecosystem, including the role of keystone species. The roles of primary and secondary producers in a community and the role of decomposers will be examined to bring the cycle to a close. Microorganisms represent the greatest diversity of life on Earth and couple the geochemical world to the living one across many ecosystems. This course will examine the role of microorganisms in biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Other topics discussed will include the symbiosis of microbes with plants, animals and other microbes to form communities. Finally, the role of microorganisms in converting or decomposing biological or geochemical materials will be addressed. Plastic is ubiquitous in our modern lives, but its proliferation is increasingly questioned because of its adverse environmental impacts. This course examines plastic pollution from a politics and policy perspective. It does so by following the life cycle of plastics, from mining resources, refinement and manufacturing to using plastic in our daily lives to disposal. Throughout the life cycle, we will consider policy tools for dealing with the identified issues. The course will have an explicit comparative perspective with case studies from around the world. This course is designed to present students with a comprehensive introduction to the sources and impacts of pollution in marine and freshwater environments.  Fundamental concepts and principles of aquatic biogeochemistry will be introduced first, including marine and freshwater chemistry, primary production and food webs. Specific pollution topics will include biological (e.g., pathogens, invasive species), physical (e.g., thermal, plastics), and chemical (e.g., nutrient loading, oil, pesticides, metals) pollutants. Recent case studies will be discussed in class such as the Fukushima disaster and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. A field trip will be organized to visit a local sewage treatment plant in Kunshan. In this course students will learn to recognize organic chemical structures and reactions that are akin to those found in living cells, as well as learn the molecular underpinnings for the many consumer goods and products we encounter and use in daily life. In addition to covering the scientific principles and applications of organic chemistry, this course will also explore how a variety of organic molecules have had an impact on history, society, and global economics. Organic Chemistry I is both an introductory and survey course for learning the foundations of organic chemistry, and is sufficient to support further studies and coursework in the areas of biology, environmental sciences, and global health. Laboratory: techniques of separation, organic reactions and preparations, and systematic identification of compounds by their spectral and chemical properties. Examines the structure and function of genomics and the flow of genomic information from parent to progeny and through populations.

During the past several decades, exploration in basic research has yielded extensive knowledge about the numerous and intricate signaling processes involved in the development and maintenance of a functional organism. In order to demonstrate the importance and processes of cellular communication, this course will focus on cell signaling mechanisms and diseases resulting from their malfunction, such as cancer, stroke, and neuron degeneration (including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Students will be exposed to current literature and cutting edge knowledge. The structure, function and evolution of the vertebrate body systems including skeletal, digestive, circulatory, respiratory and nervous systems. Emphasis on understanding the functional, evolutionary and developmental basis for the similarities and difference observed among living vertebrates. In addition, examination of the physiological principles that function within these systems using examples like neural control, gas exchange, movement, excretion and metabolism. The laboratory portion will examine the various systems (muscular, skeletal, nervous, etc.) of human and non-human anatomical specimens. It will also include experiments examining the physiological aspects of the nervous, and respiratory systems. Consent of instructor is required. Mechanisms of fertilization, control of cell divisions, diversification of cell types, organization and differentiation of cells and tissues of the organism, and patterning necessary to establish the body plan of many organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants.

BIOL 203 examines DarwinÕs theories of natural selection and evolution through multiple lenses in scientific and humanistic disciplines. This course covers the key concepts of biological evolution, examines how simple behaviors evolve in animals and humans, and explores current ideas about the evolution of complex social behaviors and societies. The course will also introduce students to the thinkers that influenced Darwin, such as economist Thomas Malthus and geologist Charles Lyell, as well as to DarwinÕs influence on later thinkers from political theorist Karl Marx to historian Yuval Noah Harari. Discussion of these topics will be grounded in scientific case studies while also considering the impact of these theories on representations of gender, race and nature in popular culture, film and media. This course is the second of a series of two general physics courses that are highly interactive and illustrated with applications from different perspective of sciences and everyday life. Core topics: electric fields, circuits, magnetic fields, Faraday’s law, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves, properties of light, geometric optics, wave optics.

Fundamentals of qualitative and quantitative measurement with emphasis on chemometrics, quantitative spectrometry, electrochemical methods, and common separation techniques, including laboratory experiments that illustrate various of these techniques. Bonding, structures, and reactions of inorganic compounds studied through physical chemical concepts. Continuation of CHEM 201. The course introduces students to core concepts in physical chemistry including quantum chemistry, molecular structure, molecular spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and kinetics. The course also includes laboratory experiments illustrative of these topics, as well as instruction and practice in writing the laboratory notebook and formal laboratory reports. This course is the continuation of the Integrated Science – Chemistry continuum, including intermolecular forces, states of matter, aqueous ionic equilibrium and solubility equilibrium, dynamics (kinetics and thermodynamics), electrochemistry, and nuclear chemistry. Lab experiments verifying related theories and utilizing data analysis are also part of the course. Builds on and extends the core concepts introduced in Elements of Physical chemistry. Advanced topics and recent developments in physical chemistry This course is designed to provide the student with an understanding of the fundamentals of aqueous geochemistry. This course focuses on the fundamental aquatic geochemical processes (e.g. mineral precipitation/dissolution, solution complexation, acid-base chemistry) that shape and transform the Earth’s surface as a result of rock-water interactions, and associated impacts on the fate and transport of inorganic and organic contaminants in aqueous and geochemical environments. Topics to be covered include the chemical composition of soils, geochemical specalation, mineral weathering and stability, sorption and ion exchange, soil redox processes, chemical kinetics at environmental surfaces, and the nature, composition, structure, and properties of pollutants coupled with the major chemical mechanisms controlling the occurrence and mobility of chemicals in the environment. Biogeochemistry is the study of how chemical elements flow through living systems and their physical environments. This course will investigate the factors that influence the cycling of those elements that are essential to life as well as the liberation, transport and exposure pathways of toxic trace elements. Concepts of nutrient limitation, element stoichiometry, primary productivity and carbon sequestration will be covered in depth, and will be applied to the study of human impacts on the global biogeochemical cycles of water, carbon, nutrients and trace metals. Mechanisms and principles underlying organic contaminant transformations in the ambient environment. Topics include hydrolysis, oxidation/reduction, direct and indirect photolysis, and reactions with disinfectant chemicals. Reactions will be considered in context of both natural (e.g. surface water and cloudwater) and engineered (e.g. drinking water, wastewater, and groundwater remediation) systems. Approaches will include both qualitative (reaction mechanism and product identification) as well as quantitative (reaction kinetics and stoichiometry) aspects of environmental reaction chemistry. Analysis of EarthÕs climate history and links between climate and society in China, as well as physical climatology and the future climate in China. Topics include: global climate system, climate feedbacks, energy balance, basic circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, hydrological cycle and carbon cycle, paleoclimate reconstruction, record of natural variations of past climate with emphasis on past changes of monsoon rainfall reconstructed from paleoclimate archives for the past, extrinsic forcing mechanisms of observed paleoclimatic variations. The impact of climate variability and change on Chinese society and history will be discussed. Ecosystem services are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems and utilizes a system level approach to examine the interactions between four services. The course will include discussion of nutrient recycling as a supporting service, food production as a provisioning service, carbon sequestration as a regulating service and education as a cultural service as well as how they fit together in a sustainable system. Students will learn through case studies of the application of conservation, restoration and market valuation approaches to protecting critical ecosystem processes. Course material includes an introduction to the structure of molecules as well as their inter- and intramolecular interactions, with an emphasis on those species of importance to food and cooking. Additional science topics include cell structure of plants and meats and methods of heat transfer. Chemical reactivity as it relates to cooking, fermentation, food preservation and spoilage will also be discussed. This course is an introduction to the theories and practices of sustainability. Sustainability is the art of living well, within the ecological limits of a finite planet. Sustainable development aims to balance economic efficiency, environmental compatibility and social equity. Students will learn and apply various concepts, frameworks, and tools related to sustainability (e.g., UN Sustainable Development Goals, planetary boundaries, circular economy, life cycle thinking, cost benefit analysis, carbon footprint, sustainability accounting and reporting). In this activity-based course, students will become practiced in sustainable approaches to environmental problems. How and why do policies come about? What is the role of media, non-governmental organizations, and politicians? Why do some issues attract the attention of policymakers while others do not? What are the obstacles for policy change? Some of the questions will be answered in this course. This course will examine the political aspects of public policy from an explicitly comparative perspective. Public policy making is not a rational, straightforward process, but is heavily shaped by processes, institutions, and actors. During the course, we will identify relevant official and non-official actors, contextual factors, and particular processes, ultimately learning how these shape public policy. Governments constantly face questions such as: How do we address deforestation? How can we slow down climate change? How can we make food safer? This course teaches a systematic way of dealing with these questions, namely policy analysis. This technique enables students to identify, examine, and evaluate options to implement policy goals. Readings will be a combination of theory and case studies from around the world. Development and application of analytical economic tools in a policy environment. Emphasis on application of economic methods in a variety of policy settings and developing testable hypotheses that might be used to guide economic policy. Analytical topics include willingness to pay, derived demand, multi-market interactions, comparative advantage, investment analysis, and decision making under uncertainty. Applications include tax analysis, including incidence, effective protection, shadow pricing, introduction to government expenditures, labor market policy, examples of regulation and pricing externalities. Introduction of the concepts of preferences and technologies. Intermediate development of the theory of demand, supply and competitive equilibrium from individual preferences and technologies. Income and substitution effects, uncompensated demand and marginal willingness to pay. Conditions under which competitive markets result in efficient outcomes. Conditions under which government policy has the potential to increase efficiency. Tension between economic efficiency and different notions of equity. Climate Change is one of the major challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Climate Change has been described as a Òsuper wicked problemÓ, which stems from the greenhouse gases emissions produced by virtually all human activities, has no simple solution and yet requires urgent and drastic action to be taken at the global level. In this course, we will examine the range of legal and policy responses to this Òwicked problemÓ which have been proposed by experts, as well as those which have been concretely applied at the international level and different jurisdictions, especially in the United States, the EU, and China, three major emitters of greenhouse gases. We will look at various studies put forward by academics and think tanks, informed newspaper articles, as well as policy documents and law. This course examines the economics of markets and policies for different energy supply sources (such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, electricity, renewables, nuclear), energy demand and efficiency, and their interactions with each other and with the rest of the economy and environment. We will explore rationales for why markets for energy and energy-using technologies have historically been subject to extensive government intervention. Other topics include markets for energy and energy-using technologies, energy price regulation, and energy security. Course will focus on the major challenges developing countries face in balancing environmental management and economic growth. Class will use economic analyses to examine these challenges and to devise policy solutions, especially given that developing countries often have weak institutional capacity and fewer financial resources to cope with environmental pollution. In this interdisciplinary course, students will examine the multifaceted aspects of “global” disasters. The first segment of the course will examine the science behind the disasters, discuss the range of meteorologic, hydrologic and geologic factors that cause disasters; explore how societies plan for and/or respond to the immediate and long-term physical, social, emotional and spiritual issues associated with survival; and present case studies of response, recovery and reconstruction efforts. In the second phase of the course, some of the most pressing and rapidly evolving economic calamities will be addressed. In the third segment of the course, the focus will shift to political “disasters” and how natural and/or economic events can destabilize a political system. Students will attend the lecture and labs components of the course and complete on-line quizzes to demonstrate understanding of the material presented.  Additionally, they will prepare one research paper on a relevant topic, the results of which will be presented to the class. This course examines problems associated with the interaction of humans with their environment. This course mainly focuses on various global environmental concerns, such as climate change, biodiversity, environmental pollution, and natural resources. This course explores case studies illustrating specific problems in different regions and countries and the proper role of local governments and intergovernmental organizations in the regulation of the environment. Students will also be expected to participate in discussions or debates on climate and environment-related issues including role play. The course will help you to understand the nature of regulatory governance in complex social environments. We will explore the reasons why governments and others use regulation as a tool to achieve policy goals, and how regulation is implemented and enforced in daily practice. Building on the work of leading regulatory governance scholars, we will explore how their theoretical insights could be applied in practical settings. Throughout the course, we will essentially ask: what can regulatory governance accomplish and what is beyond its reach? Regulation of societal risks was long seen as the province of state administrative institutions, but recent theories and practice challenge this view. A move away from a state-centred approach to governance has created space for non-state actors to assume a myriad of regulatory roles. This course will introduce theories and practices of non-state regulation. Drawing on cases from across the globe, this course will explore the multifaceted roles non-state actors can play in regulatory and governance processes. Cases examining how private individuals, civil society organizations, social entrepreneurs, enterprises, philanthropists and others have tried to change the world will be analysed. This course helps students understand what happens during and after a disaster in terms of politics and policy. It is structured around five themes: crisis detection; decision-making and coordination; crisis communication; accountability; and learning and policy change. During the course, we will apply each of these themes to case studies of environmental crises, for example oil spills and chemical leaks. Readings will be a combination of theory and case studies from around the world. This interdisciplinary course draws on philosophy, sociology and public policy to explore ethical leadership in the twenty-first century. From the challenges facing governments to decisions students confront daily, this course seeks to create and evaluate solutions to ethical dilemmas in a global world. Does a government have the right to insist on another governmentÕs adherence to human rights standards? Should a museum be forced to return artifacts that were stolen centuries before the museum acquired them? Do corporations have an obligation to invest in their local communities? Do we have an obligation to help the poor and if so why? What should be the relation between markets in which goods and services are exchanged, the state that has potential supportive and regulatory functions toward the markets, and ethical values such as human welfare, the desire for meaningful work, equality, and justice?  To what extent can and should markets be regulated by the state for the sake of such values? Should businesses act on moral values as well as the profit motive? To what extent should consumers guide their choices in the market according to ethical values? An interdisciplinary approach through philosophy, political theory and economics. This course will examine democracy and meritocracy, exploring specifically the components, strengths, and liabilities of each. Particular focus will be on intersections between virtue, democracy and meritocracy. Readings will come from philosophy, political theory, history, and sociology. Potential application of these theories to the United States and to China, among other countries, will be discussed. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Ethics and Leadership. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines. The seminar will foster the ability to see their disciplinary knowledge from a wider perspective and to apply it flexibly. Specific topics will vary. This seminar is required for all juniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor.

Leadership works through the cultivation of trust between leaders and the people they lead. Leaders make trade-offs in providing direction (Òcoercive controlÓ) versus cultivating trust-based commitment (Òenabling controlÓ). Recently, there has emerged the concept of Òsoft power,Ó which is the power to get others to want what you want through their attraction to your culture. Leaders often face the challenge of fostering trust across diverse cultures, values, and beliefs. This course draws on philosophy, political science, organizational behavior, sociology and psychology to study the conditions that foster trust within and across societies, and between leaders, the institutions of governance and the governed. The gap between those who receive the best health care and those who receive the worst health care in the world is staggering. Do all people have an equal right to long life and prosperity regardless of where they happen to live?  Is there a right to basic health care? What should the most advantaged nations do for the least advantaged? This course studies philosophical theories of global justice, along with particular issues such as the Òbrain drainÓ of health care personnel from developing to rich countries, and the alleged bias of pharmaceutical companies against developing drugs most needed in developing markets. How do human beings make judgments about whether the conditions of society are just or unjust? What effect does living under conditions of severe and pervasive injustice have on human psychology? This course will examine these questions through consideration of two topic areas. By examining moral psychology, students will learn the role of emotions, empathy, group membership in our moral judgments and behaviors. By examining the concept of injustice, students will understand ways in which features of human psychology allow people to take morally problematic stances towards other people, while studying the psychological effects this has on individuals. Behavioral economics and the idea of ÒnudgingÓ have captured the attention of policy makers and the public. The idea that situations can be structured to make some choices and practices easier (and thus more likely) and make others harder (and thus less likely) is well established in psychology, organizational behavior, political science and sociology, but this raises the question of whether it is ethical for those in power to intentionally structure situations to nudge people one way or the other. This course will examine the work on behavioral economics and nudging, and the earlier research in other fields that underpins ÒnudgingÓ and the practical moral dilemmas it raises. Religious, philosophical, social and cultural psychology explain how morality varies so much across cultures, despite the fact that cultures share so many similarities and recurrent themes. This course explores the foundation, the virtues, narratives, and institutions that sit on top of shared moral foundations, and the ways in which they lead to conflict within and across nations as well as the possibilities for managing that conflict. Do we know anything at all? If we do, how do we know it?  How does knowledge differ from opinion and belief? Perception is a major avenue to knowledge, but what is it and under what conditions can we trust it?  Our perceptions are influenced by what we already believe about the world. Does this make our perceptions untrustworthy since our beliefs can often be wrong? These related set of questions, collectively understood as the basic problems of epistemology, have challenged thinkers across the world and over centuries. This course examines a variety of ancient and modern approaches to these questions. Logic is the study of the conditions of good reasoning and clear communication.  Logic is an indispensable tool for an indispensable feature of human life: entertaining, assessing and crafting arguments. This course is designed to equip students with some basic skills in distinguishing good arguments from bad ones by introducing them to formal systems of logic and rules of reasoning. The goals of this course focus on reaching proficiency in particular skills in deductive and inductive logic, largely through practicing their application. The skills cultivated in this class have a broad relevance to critical thinking generally, and so students will leave this course with preparation to extend principles of critical thinking into many domains, both academic and not. This course focuses on the origins of the European philosophical tradition, with an emphasis on metaphysics, theory of knowledge, ethics and politics. The course reads primary texts of Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius and Epicurus and other key western thinkers in English translation. The course examines the significance of these key approaches to philosophy in the later development of the European philosophical tradition, and considers their relevance for the contemporary global context. This course introduces the foundations of Chinese thought with a focus on the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.E.), a period in which schools of thought like Confucianism, Mohism, and Daoism originally flourished. Students will read selections from the most famous classical Chinese philosophy texts in English translation. The course emphasizes close reading of texts, with a view to understanding their key concepts and issues, as well as forms of argumentation. In so doing, students will think through the key questions that animated intense debate between key schools of philosophy, and examine how these key debates have influenced the development of Chinese culture right through to the present day. Modern European philosophy centers on the theories of knowledge, morality and metaphysics of key thinkers of the 17th- and 18th-centuries, notably Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. Together, these thinkers brought to birth a distinctively European approach to humanism, in dialog with science and reason, that has resonated powerfully across the world. This course examines their key arguments by reading selected primary texts, and debates their continued relevance in the contemporary world. The early Mediterranean civilizations (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome) and dynastic China have been profoundly influential in the development of world civilizations, and in how human civilization is conceived. How do they compare in their traditions of thought about how one ought to live, theories of government and governance, and methods and aims in study of the natural world? This course offers a basic introduction to early Chinese and Western thought through examination of selected primary texts in English translation. As well as analyzing these approaches to philosophy in their historical and cultural context, the course debates their continuing relevance in a global context. Climate change has come into focus as a defining problem of the 21st century, but the challenges it presents are not limited to the arenas of engineering, science, and economics. Climate change also represents a challenge for some of our key moral concepts, for our understanding of moral theory, and for our ability to enact morally sensible collective policies and construct morally responsible individual lives. This course will explore ethical dimensions of climate change, including questions concerning moral responsibility for climate woes, possible responses to problematic climate effects, and the implications of climate change for environmental ethics more generally. Existing democracies are marred by long-standing inequalities, deep-seated exclusions, and profound injustices. Many argue, however, that it is possible to create much more ÒinclusiveÓ democratic societies. This course examines the core ideals behind this hope, the prospects for its realization, and the dilemmas of its pursuit. We look at normative and empirical literatures, drawn from diverse contexts and disciplines. Central questions include: When actors envision a more Òjust,Ó ÒinclusiveÓ democratic society, what precisely are they envisioning? How do they justify their visions? What major strategies have been employed to create more ÒinclusiveÓ democratic processes, and how effectively have they worked? This course examines classical and contemporary theories of justice in Western philosophical ethics and applies them to modern dilemmas that have dominated political and cultural conflict in the modern West. These topics include questions of economic justice in relation to capitalism and communism; the question of human rights as a supreme and universal value that cuts across all social and cultural contexts; the profound challenges of slavery, colonialism and racial justice that haunt American politics in the present day; the continuing quest for gender equality; and contemporary issues of gender politics including same-sex marriage and the recognition of transgender and nonbinary identities. The Global Philosophy course offers a gateway for students to critically engage with the diverse philosophical traditions that inform the making of the increasingly pluralistic modern world. The aim of the course is to cultivate deep appreciation of diversity and to help students develop a culturally sensible map of the worldÕs philosophical traditions that will help them deal with the compelling challenges in this multicultural age. This course examines the morality of our treatment of nonhuman animals. We will start by considering the cognitive and emotional capacities of some nonhuman animals. After that, the course will be divided into 3 units. Unit 1 will cover ethical questions surrounding the use of animals for food. Unit 2, on animal companionship, will consider what moral responsibilities we have to our animal companions, and how they compare to the responsibilities we have towards our human friends. Finally, Unit 3, on animal captivity, will address moral issues associated with the human practice of using animals for the purpose of entertainment. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence, via machine learning techniques that leverage big data, has made breakthroughs in a variety of domains. While some believe AI is still nothing but a tool, others believe we are on the verge of a technological singularity Ð the invention of an artificial superintelligence that will trigger exponential technological advancement that will change humanity in unpredictable ways. In this course we will begin with philosophical reflection on the nature of AI and then consider ethical issues that lie on a spectrum from highly speculative projections regarding the future of AI to highly practical issues that are being generated by actual AI applications being deployed today: internet usage, profiling, and autonomous vehicles among others. Philosophical questions arise frequently in sporting contexts, and pursuing those questions can be profitable in both directions: on the one hand, emerging issues in sport often require philosophical engagement in order to make progress on a question of practical importance, while on the other hand, reexamining and deploying concepts and theories in the sporting context can helpfully reshape our thinking. The pivotal concepts at the core of this course are fairness and exploitation. WeÕll examine these concepts through a combination of great works in the history of philosophy, contemporary work in analytic philosophy, and recent sporting controversies This course is an introduction to the basic questions about mind: What is consciousness? Is the mind really like a computer or something quite different? Can thoughts, perceptions, feelings and intentions be explained in terms of events and processes in the brain and nervous system?  How do we know there are minds other than our own?  Although philosophers across the world have considered these questions for many centuries, the contemporary study of mind is heavily dependent on more recent scientific discoveries in cognitive psychology, neuroscience and computer science. The course demonstrates how philosophy has rapidly developed through engagement with these sciences. In this class we will explore several classic philosophical issues by learning how to program in Python. This is made possible by the close affinity that is shared between a number of computational concepts and their philosophical counterparts. For example, the concept of recursion can help us think about the existence of God by way of infinity. Completing this class will give you rudimentary Python programming skills and the ability to critically engage several philosophical issues. The ideal student will have an interest in both disciplines but have no prior knowledge of either. This course examines the principal philosophical problems of scientific practice with a view to explaining what science is and how it works. Students will learn how science may be distinguished from pseudo-science, how and why scientific theories change, and whether science can ever give us a fully accurate description of reality. The course focuses on what constitutes scientific explanation, how experimentation can confirm or deny scientific hypotheses, and the contrast between instrumentalist and realist conceptions of scientific theory. The course also examines the notion of scientific laws, and how these concepts may be challenged by the question of indeterminism that emerges in post-classical science. When doing philosophy we think about the world and about ourselves in it. This includes our thoughts about the world as well as our actions and interactions with it and one another. In this course, we will consider related foundational philosophical contributions on the nature of human thought, action, and their connection. In doing so we will attend closely to key elements of the practice of philosophical thinking and writing, including standards of logical argumentation and of academic philosophical writing. We will dedicate ourselves particularly to developing and honing our own philosophical writing skills in accordance with these standards. The U.S. Constitution is the foundation of the American legal and political system. It is the oldest national constitution still in effect, and it has influenced many subsequent constitutions around the world. According to its admirers, it has played a central role in the rise of the United States as a global superpower. Its critics, on the other hand, claim that it has produced an increasingly unequal society and a dysfunctional political system. This course will help students to better understand the basic structure of the U.S. Constitution, its history, and the political debates to which it has given rise. We will begin by examining the arguments raised for and against the Constitution when it was first proposed in the eighteenth century, before turning to the study of several contemporary political challenges in which constitutional questions play a prominent role, namely those concerning race, free speech, and the power of the American presidency. The central goal of this course is to provide students with analytical competence, enterprising leadership identity, and personal agency important to exercising leadership in organizations, in communities, and in life. The course explores the many facets of leadership and leadership development including the processes by which people affect change in a variety of roles and situations. Leadership within a framework of ethics, values, and innovative action are emphasized as a basis for contributing to the process of making good things happen without reliance on formal authority. The course considers the question, “How can we fix poverty?” It begins by exploring the nature of poverty through a variety of descriptive metaphors (for example, poverty as a “trap” or a “disease”). It then considers the word “we,” and in doing so introduces several basic understandings of ethics (deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, etc.) Finally it considers the word “fix” and offers three models for responding to poverty: working for, working with, and being with. Explores relationship between state, family formation, and individuals. Surveys regulation of sexuality, reproduction, adoption, immigration, and incarceration with focus mainly on U.S. and past 200 years. This course introduces students to the field of human rights. The course has two primary purposes: to define and explore the key terms, concepts, foundations and theories of human rights; and examine alternative or competing definitions of rights using a case-based approach. Examines the intersection of law and neuroscience, including the use of neuroimaging to determine if a witness is telling the truth; the implications of neuroscience for determining the mental competency of defendants, the insanity defense, the imposition of punishment on defendants. Considers the extent to which recent advances in brain science cause us to reevaluate fundamental legal concepts of “intent,” “insanity,” and responsibility; the ways in which neuroscience may be applied to these and related issues; and the inherent limitations and incongruities of applying brain science to legal questions. Ethical inquiry into journalism and its effect on public discourse. Issues include accuracy, transparency, conflicts of interest and fairness. Topics include coverage of national security, government secrecy, plagiarism/fabrication, and trade-offs of anonymous sourcing. This course explores the ways in which a variety of religious traditions across the world have shaped fundamental conceptions of humanityÕs place within nature, including the kinds of environmental ethics that arise from these conceptions. The course examines the foundational texts and practices of selected world religions and considers how these texts and practices are being used by contemporary religious leaders to shape religious responses to current ecological challenges, such as environmental pollution, global climate change, and the factory farming of nonhuman animals. Who are you? What might you become? What is the world and does the world have a purpose? Questions like these lie at the heart of religious traditions around the world, and have inspired and frightened humans since the very beginning of our history. In this course, we will explore some of these traditions by going on a vision quest, a journey for insight. We will encounter ghosts, people who can fly, charismatic healers, and many more weird things. This is a course that might change your life. Welcome to the study of religion. Different religions have portrayed leaders in different ways, through stories, exemplars and which attributes of leaders and followers are emphasized or downplayed.  Drawing upon a wide variety of resources in religious studies, history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and cultural studies, this course will examine how a wide variety of religions depict leaders and leadership, highlighting both the differences and the similarities across religions and within religious traditions. The course will also draw upon research on leadership, cultural values, and norms to systematically compare and contrast how religion shapes perceptions of leadership.  Applications explored will include religion-based portrayals of gender, race ethnicity, and age in assessing leaders.  Also considered will be whether these portrayals make specific religious lenses more or less amenable to leadership development in different contexts (for example where innovation is important or where co-leadership is essential). It is often said that there are three teachings that have defined Chinese society through the ages. Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism are traditions that have produced some of the most profound, provoking, and funny ideas and practices in the history of humankind. In this course, we will examine these ideas and practices intellectually and experientially. In doing so, you will not only gain a firm knowledge of some of the most important sources of East-Asian culture, but also a new perspective on your own life.Ó In contrast to the Chinese concept of the Òthree traditionsÓ, Islamic tradition came to define the overlapping identity of Jewish, Christian and Islamic peoples by the concept of Òthe people of the bookÓ. This course offers an introduction to the three traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam by focusing on the concept of the sacred text as the written revelation of God. Comparisons between the Jewish torah, Christian gospels and Islamic law, and the practices of scribes, commentators, and textual scholars illuminate the similarities and also differences between the three great monotheistic traditions of the world. This course examines how and why religious traditions propose ethical norms, their continued significance in the contemporary world, and recent attempts to foster a more inclusive, global approach to ethics. Whether formulated in divine laws, ritual formulas or monastic codes, religious traditions have asserted their authority and identity by specifying what they regard as the ultimate norms for human conduct. These norms were formulated in the last Axial period around 2,500 years ago and reflect the values and interests of those societies. The course examines the continuing impact and relevance of these norms on contemporary life, and pays particular attention to attempts to shape global ethical norms especially in relation to global issues such as climate change. This course introduces the Hindu concepts of daana (vision of the gods) and dharma (path) so as to explore how religious visions, as represented in art, architecture and mythology, engage the social and material reality of religious practitionersÕ daily lives. In so doing it exposes the cultural power of religious frameworks to structure normative hierarchies of gender, class and race. Students gain a functional understanding of religious cultures that may be applied to other traditions and contexts by way of comparison. This course focuses on the concept of religious law, the traditions of jurisprudence that emerge in religious societies, and their relationship to the modern nation state. It introduces students to the Islamic concepts of QurÕan, Sharia, and Fiqh (jurisprudence) with a view to understanding how divine laws function in human societies. Topics include concepts of divine revelation, sacred texts, law codes, legal institutions and modern forms of fundamentalism. Other religious traditions may also be included by way of comparison. An examination of Buddhism in Asia, Europe, and the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. The course emphasizes how global exchanges resulted in the emergence of Buddhism in the United States and Europe, and the transformation of Buddhism in Asia. The course takes a number of case studies in the transformation of Buddhism including the emergence of humanistic Buddhism in modern China; the American encounter with Japanese Zen; and the relationship between Buddhism and ethnic militarism in Imperial Japan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. In all cases the course examines how Buddhism transformed in response to the emergence of new global contexts. This course studies the role of religion in establishing the founding mythology of peoples and nations. It introduces students to the Jewish tradition by way of example, and considers the role of the foundational mythology of the Jews in multiple forms of Judaism from early Israelite religion to modern Zionism. The course leads to an examination of the experience of holocaust, the quest for Jewish statehood and its impact upon the political situation in the Middle East. In so doing the course develops broad theoretical approaches in religious studies that can serve wider interests in understanding the relationship between nation, state, ethnicity, and religious belonging. Other religious contexts may be introduced by way of comparison. This course studies the relationships among charismatic authority, priestly tradition, religious institutions, and state power. It uses as a case study the historical context of Palestine in the first century CE and examines the social and political context for the emergence of the Christian movement inspired by the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Topics include the nature of authority, religious resistance to state power, the concept of divine law, and popular sects. Other religious contexts may also be included in order to offer a comparative perspective. This course introduces students to a variety of religious literature and sacred texts from across the world. Students learn how to read and interpret these texts and in this way come to reflect on the nature of religion and its function in human societies. In addition discussing fundamental theological questions about the nature of existence, the course will also examine the practical ways in which religions shape the embodied lives of religious practitioners across the world. Exploration of the problem of the human condition for Eastern and Western religious thought. This courses examines theological, philosophical, psychological, and popular cultural conceptions and responses. It explores how traditions of religious thought have conceptualized the basic problem of the human condition, whether as the consequences of karmic bonds, the general condition of human ignorance, or a lack of proper moral training. At the same time the course offers a framework for understanding religious movements as positing solutions to the problems they identify, whether conceptualized as salvation, liberation, perfection, or immortality. This courses explores the problem of evil for Eastern and Western religious thought and discusses several attempts to confront the reality of evil, to square that with oneÕs worldview, and to find a way of living with that worldview.  This courses examines theological, philosophical, psychological, and popular cultural conceptions and responses. This course provides a comprehensive overview of the Chinese economy and ChinaÕs role in the world economy. ChinaÕs current economic challenges will be given particular attention. Topics addressed will include: the Chinese economy before 1949; the socialist era, 1949-1978; economic reform and market transition; the role of state enterprises; the return of private and family business; foreign investment; foreign trade; ChinaÕs role in the East Asian trade-production network; ChinaÕs evolving financial system; Chinese monetary and exchange rate policy; ChinaÕs role in global trade balances; the internationalization of the Yuan; and the current effort to rebalance the Chinese economy from an investment to a consumption economy. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Global China Studies. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines. The seminar will foster the ability to see their disciplinary knowledge from a wider perspective and to apply it flexibly. Specific topics will vary. This seminar is required for all seniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor. This course examines concepts and theories of empire, imperialism, colonialism, and the nation-state, with a particular focus on their circulation and impact in East Asia and China. We trace the history of Western theories of “nation,” looking at what the term meant prior to the European nation-state and the imperialist and colonial projects of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and we examine what they mean in the present era of multiculturalism and globalization. We explore how historically Chinese conceptions of civilization and empire were transformed in post-imperial era. We look also at how related concepts of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and culture have traveled from the West, through the Soviet Union, to China and beyond. How is the Chinese political system organized? What are the rules, both formal and informal, about how policy is made in China? What determines whether a policy actually works in China? How do everyday people experience politics in China?  This class introduces students to readings, arguments, and concepts that begin to explore the answers to these questions. One of the goals for the class is that students can start to recognize systematic patterns and a logic of action in how the Chinese political system operates. From filmÕs first appearance at a Shanghai teahouse in August 1896 to Jackie ChanÕs latest transnational stardom, the history of modern Chinese cinema has always sought to raise questions of national and cultural identity. How do Chinese films between the two fins-de-si\\x8fcle create the spectacle of ÒChina,Ó narrate its history, and represent its increasingly diversified cultural landscapes both at home and abroad? Students will study photography, documentary film, cinema and social media in China from the 1930s ÒLeftistÓ films to present. This course provides a comprehensive overview of the Chinese economy and ChinaÕs role in the world economy. ChinaÕs current economic challenges will be given particular attention. Topics addressed will include: the Chinese economy before 1949; the socialist era, 1949-1978; economic reform and market transition; the role of state enterprises; the return of private and family business; foreign investment; foreign trade; ChinaÕs role in the East Asian trade-production network; ChinaÕs evolving financial system; Chinese monetary and exchange rate policy; ChinaÕs role in global trade balances; the internationalization of the Yuan; and the current effort to rebalance the Chinese economy from an investment to a consumption economy. The rise of China and its economic transition are inseparable from the workings of the factories and the feminization of labor on those assembly lines. For most workers, the factory has been not simply a place to work, but also a ÒhabitusÓ where rest, sustenance, leisure and consumption are conditioned, regulated, and at times, contested. In this highly interdisciplinary course we will examine the factory not only as a political and economic unit of disciplined work, but also as a cultural and ideological space wherein dreams and anxieties are produced and exhausted. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Global China Studies. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines.

This seminar is required for all juniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor. This course examines the origin stories of Chinese civilization as found in the historical documents and archeological evidence from the Warring States period. Students use primary source material and historical evidence to interpret the theories of Confucius, Mozi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Han Feizi in their historical, social and political contexts, with special regard to the their understanding of the state, the role of government, the military, and civil education. The course then examines the attempts to forge a unified empire, finally achieved under the Qin, and the subsequent policies of the Han dynasty that aimed to make the unified empire last. The course involves visits to local archeological sites where relevant. This course examines what Hu Shi has called the ÒIndianizationÓ of China. It traces the import of Buddhist ideas, values and practices from India and central Asia, and their impact on Chinese society, religion and politics. It examines the notion of China as multireligious, multiethnic empire and considers the transition from political diversity in the Six Dynasties period to renewed unity in Sui and Tang dynasties. With ChangÕan (XiÕan) as the capital of a culturally rich and diverse China, the course examines the impact of a newly discovered inner-Asian cosmopolitanism on Tang aristocracy, culture, religion and politics. The course introduces the foundations of modern China from the Song Dynasty up through the late imperial period (about 1800 CE to 1911). It will cover the major historical events, developments, and trends — social, political, economic, philosophical, literary, cultural, multi-ethnic, and ChinaÕs relations with the other regions. The main focus of the course will be on primary sources, which include dynastic histories, historical biographies, novels, folktales, satires, poetry, contracts, ritual manuals, diaries, letters, scientific treatises, philological studies, and court debates. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach, integrating history with literary studies, philosophy, and anthropology, in order for student to better understand these texts in their historical context. This survey course covers art in a variety of contexts from the foundations of Chinese civilization until the end of the imperial period in 1912 including tomb artefacts, religious images and statuary, court art, crafted objects and the painting and calligraphy of the literati. A number of themes may be addressed, such as the cross-cultural transmission of ornamentation and iconography, the ideal of scholar-amateur, the skills and techniques of the professional artisan and the connoisseurship and circulation of fine objects.

A number of themes may be addressed, such as the cross-cultural transmission of ornamentation and iconography, the ideal of scholar-amateur, the skills and techniques of the professional artisan and the connoisseurship and circulation of fine objects. ChinaÕs vast material power and professed developing country status place it in a unique and highly influential position with respect to the Global South. In this course, we will examine the political economy of contemporary ChinaÕs relations with the Global South, covering topics including ChinaÕs development and humanitarian assistance, trade and investment, Chinese soft power, and itÕs expanding security presence. We will explore how the politics of these topics shapes their economics and vice versa, and unpack the interests and roles of the many different state and non-state actors involved. This course looks at the Chinese-American alliance during World War II from multiple perspectives. What did the partners in this anti-Japanese alliance have in common?  What was the level of their mutual understanding?  What was the role of key decision-makers in Chongqing, Washington, and Yanan?  How did the various actors imagine Chinese-American relations after the war?  What can we learn from a Chinese-American alliance that was at once successful and fragile? The Unites States is home to many of the worldÕs leading universities, at present.  China has developed the fastest growing system of higher educationÑin quality as in quantityÑin the world.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of these systems, each of which is very diverse?  How can we best compare admissions systems?  Governance systems?  Research results? And Educational outcomes?  What can each system learn from the other? This course introduces the rich and diverse world of trade, religions, and cultures that connected the two ends of the Eurasian world. It starts with survey of Han and Roman trade contacts, and Chinese connections with India via Buddhism, focusing on 7th-15 centuries CE. It examines global interactions produced by the land-based silk routes, including the coming of Islam and Nestorian Christians to China, and travelers to China during the vast Mongol Empire including Marco Polo, It also documents the opening of maritime silk routes through the voyages of the Chinese admiral Zheng He to Africa at the beginning of the 15th century. This course studies how foreign relations have shaped modern China from the Opium War to Alibaba. Topics include commercialization, militarization, and industrialization in the making of the modern state; the international education of Chinese at home and abroad; foreigners in China; the international evolution of Chinese enterprise under capitalism and socialism; the PeopleÕs Republic and the socialist world economy of the 1950s and 1960s; theÊÒinternational development of ChinaÓ as conceived by Sun Yat-sen, and the birth of the modern infrastructure state; the Chinese diaspora and the re-opening of China after 1978; contemporary ChinaÕs state-led and private investments abroad and the emergence of a Chinese global citizenry. This course explores everyday life in Maoist China through the perspective of material culture. Objects, such as the Red Book, Mao badges, propaganda posters, statues, and wall paintings, were produced in and of importance to the Mao era. Everywhere in peopleÕs daily life, these objects constituted a crucial component of the social, economic, and political order under Mao. Drawing on the combination of archival sources, digital materials, and secondary literature, this course looks at the creation, transformation, and implication of Maoist material objects and their connections to contemporary China. Students have opportunities to sharpen their writing and analytical skills through a series of innovative writing assignments. This special topics course focuses on the historical development of a specific set of institutions in China, such as the evolution of health care, social welfare, military organizations, or child and family institutions over time. In so doing the course provides an opportunity for students to dive deeply into the historical evolution of institutions as a way to understand the development of modern China in a specific sphere. In this way students gain a deep, specialized knowledge in the history of a particular area, and then demonstrate how that knowledge can be applied more broadly to better understand the historical evolution of modern Chinese society. From the fourth century BCE onwards, the device of the dream has allowed Chinese writers, performers and intellectuals to explore social transgression and other liminal states of being. We will examine dreams in wide array of texts from Zhuangzi to the plays of Tang Xianzu and Dream of the Red Chamber in order to understand core humanistic concerns such as love (qing) and the futility of earthly desire and ambition. With a focus on kunqu, students will engage with Chinese drama (original or in translation) both in recording and by visiting live performances.

This interdisciplinary course combining the fields of history, sociology, urban studies and urban ethnography examines Shanghai, ChinaÕs most modern and dynamic city since the 19th century, through the lens of its nighttime leisure pursuits. It explores how the cityÕs nightlife has contributed to its identity and image as a global cosmopolitan metropolis. This interdisciplinary course explores the live music scenes of cities in China today and the history of those scenes over the past century. Focusing on the urban space of the live house featuring jazz, blues, rock, hip hop, electronica, and DJs, we will delve into these scenes and styles of music. Major topics touched upon in this course include globalization, localization, creative cultures and industries, and musical communities and scenes. Cities covered in this course will include Beijing, Shanghai, Kunshan, and Suzhou. Writing assignments will focus on analyzing particular scenes based on research and observations. This course looks at the Chinese-American alliance during World War II from multiple perspectives. What did the partners in this anti-Japanese alliance have in common?  What was the level of their mutual understanding?  What was the role of key decision-makers in Chongqing, Washington, and Yanan? What was the experience of this alliance from the perspective of ordinary soldiers and the civilians they encountered?  How did the various actors imagine Chinese-American relations after the war?  What can we learn from a Chinese-American alliance that was at once successful and fragile? A survey of basic tools in economics. Examination of how commodity demand is determined, what affects supply of the commodity, how price is determined, when optimal market allocation of resources and failure occur, and basic topics concerning the aggregate economy. Students will apply these principles to contemporary social science issues. Calculus-based generalization of the theory of demand and supply developed in Intermediate Microeconomics I. Individual behavior in environments of risk and uncertainty. Introduction to game theory and strategic interaction. Adverse selection, moral hazard, non-competitive market structures, externalities, public goods. Introduction to the theory and practice of econometrics. Estimation, hypothesis testing and model evaluation in the linear regression model. Observational and experimental methods to identify causal effects including instrumental variable and panel data methods. Lectures are supplemented by labs that use STATA. Intermediate level treatment of macroeconomic models, fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, unemployment, economic growth. Foundations of the field of industrial organization, including the theory of the firm, models of competition, market structure, pricing and dynamic models. Emphasis on theory with support from specific industries, including telecommunications, retail and airlines. Use of computational techniques to operationalize basic concepts from economics. Expressive marketplaces: combinatorial auctions and exchanges, winner determination problem. Game theory: normal and extensive-form games, equilibrium notions, computing equilibria. Mechanism design: auction theory, automated mechanism design. This is a introductory course in mathematical models in Þnance, centered around the problem of pricing and hedging derivative securities. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the evolution of the stock market, the theory naturally involves probabilistic tools and structures such as conditioning, martingales and Markov processes. To focus on the main idea, we will work in discrete-time setting and a simple model so called binomial asset pricing model for most of the course. In addition, we will also discuss a foreign exchange model, an extension of the binomial model with a second currency and derives the Black-Scholes equation. Economic development of the Middle East from the rise of Islam to the present. Transformation of the region from an economically advanced area into part of the underdeveloped world. Role of religion in economic successes and failures. Obstacles to development today. Topics: Islamic economic institutions, economic roles of Islamic law, innovation and change, political economy of modernization, interactions with other regions, economic consequences of Islamism. Examination of the enormous differences in living standards across countries, which reflect differences in growth experiences. Course studies both analytical foundations of modern growth theory and the most recent advances in modeling to shed light on old and new questions about such experiences. The operations of commercial and central banking and non-banking financial institutions and instruments in the United States, determination of monetary aggregates and interest rates, the financial impacts of Treasury operations, and the linkages from Federal Reserve actions to price level, employment, economic growth, and balance of payments objectives. Coverage of models of monetary economics (for example the Cagan money demand function, cash in advance models). The dynamics and real effects of inflation. Economic aspects of the production, distribution, and organization of health care services, such as measuring output, structure of markets, demand for services, pricing of services, cost of care, financing, mechanisms, and their impact on the relevant markets. The economics of globalization and trade policy are the focus of this course.  Topics will include the Ricardian Model of Comparative Advantage, benefits (and costs) of free trade, trade policies and protectionism, trade and economic relations between industrialized countries, policies toward developing countries and the development of multilateral international institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the European Union.  At all times the economic theory we study will be presented in the context of current and historical events and ongoing International Trade and policy debates. This course is a reading and research seminar that aims to provide students with a solid, broad understanding of ChinaÕs reform policies, programs, and strategies since 1978. It also examines the lessons the Chinese reformers and people learned from the 40-year reform experience as well as the challenges facing the Chinese economy and society in the future. Reading materials include both authoritative and new works on ChinaÕs politics, institutions, and economic development at various stages of the reform period. Students have opportunities to apply basic economic theories to the empirical analysis of ChinaÕs economic transitions and sociopolitical change.

The purpose of this course is to examine and understand issues related to political institutions and processes. The main topics that will be examined over the course of the semester include the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study how policy-making processes vary across different institutional arrangements. Course explores the economic, political, and security issues in East Asia. Examines respective theoretical and historical backgrounds of the region (Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, southeast Asia). Focuses on issues surrounding the region, including globalization, economic interdependence, nuclear proliferation, territorial disputes, and terrorism. Utilization of some international relation theory and methodological tools for more systematic analysis of these issues. Readings will be drawn from international relations theory, political science and history. The theory and practice of international politics and foreign policy; analysis of the various elements of national power and its impact on differing world views and foreign policy behavior, the instruments of foreign policy, and the controls of state/nation behavior across different historical periods and from different national and analytical perspectives. The goal of this course is to understand the fundamental alternative political ideologies or theories that have shaped our world and to consider which political theories may shape our world in the future.  To accomplish this goal we will 1) Investigate the theories at the foundation of liberal democracy, capitalism, Marxism, fascism, and anti-liberal Islam; 2) Consider how each of these theories addresses such fundamental human questions as: What is the best form of government? What is the nature of human beings?  3) Study through close textual analysis the principal arguments both for and against each of these theories. The course responds to the widespread media coverage and commentary suggesting that democracies around the world are backsliding into authoritarianism by treating Òthe threat of democratic erosion as an empirical question, rather than merely a political oneÓ. The first week of the course focuses on definitionsÑdemocracy, democratic consolidation, democratic erosion. In each of the next six weeks, the following particular themes will be investigated: institutions, populism, the media, polarization, exclusion, and resistance. This course provides an overview of the evolving architecture, processes and variable outcomes of global governance. Governance, at whatever level of social organization it occurs, refers to the systems of authoritative rules, norms, institutions, and practices by means of which any collectivity, from the local to the global, manages its common affairs. Global governance is generally defined as an instance of governance in the absence of government. There is no government at the global level: the UN General Assembly is not a global parliament, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is not the president of the world. But there is governance, of variable effectiveness. The course is divided into four sections. The first briefly introduces the subject. The second examines the core elements in the traditional architecture of global governance – its institutional and legal foundation. The third surveys emerging trends in that architecture. The fourth (and longest) section explores the key policy processes performed by/in/through global governance, addressing how and why they differ across different issue areas. This course helps students understand the interactions among states in East Asia since WW II. It surveys the major events, introduces theories from international relations related to the strategic balance, realism and constructivism, international political economy, decision-making, domestic politics, leadership and bureaucratic politics. Part III looks at ChinaÕs and AmericaÕs relationships with Asian countries while Part IV analyzes key issues, including the Korean nuclear crisis, the South and East China seas, and the future of the region. The course will include a simulation game, when students engage in crisis management, thereby enhancing their understanding of the dilemmas of foreign policy decision making. This course introduces the ideas of 4 social theorists: Tocqueville, Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. Described as Òthe founding fathersÓ of modern social theory, these thinkers sought to understand modern society, and its pathologies, in order to improve human life. Their ideas Ð such as public opinion and democratic despotism, alienation and ideology, rationalization and disenchantment, and organic solidarity and anomie Ð are still used by social scientists today to analyze and frame social, economic, and political problems. How do different groups with different levels of political power shape political outcomes? How do gender, racial, environmental, and social inequalities express themselves through the political system? What is a ÔfairÕ level of inequality? How do different institutional designs shape and channel inequality? This class introduces students to readings, arguments, and concepts that begin to explore the answers to these questions. In the past, the poet was regarded, not as an antipolitical bohemian nor as a political partisan, but rather as a wise teacher who could help us to understand the drama of human life as a whole and the drama of political life in particular. The goal of this course is to investigate the nature of politics and human nature by studying a number of masterpieces of classical literature. As we study these works, we will consider such themes as the equality of the sexes, democracy and aristocracy, science and politics, religion and politics, love and politics, and ambition and politics.

The central theme of this course is to examine the liberal conception of democracy as the aggregation of individual preferences. Students will explore and study questions such as: How can a collective (e.g., the electorate, legislature, collegial court, expert panel, or committee) arrive at coherent collective choices or judgments on some issues, on the basis of its members’ individual preferences? Who decide whose preferences should be counted? Do voters have the freedom to choose? What methods are used to aggregate preferences? What are the theoretical properties of these methods?  How easily can outcomes be manipulated or distorted? Are there widespread election frauds? Answers to these questions are utmost important for any democratic decision-making body. Social choice theory will be used as our theoretical framework for the analysis of combining individual opinions, preferences, interests, or welfares to reach a collective decision. This course addresses the complex relationship between China and the United States including the two countries’ foreign relations, trade, cultural exchanges, and images and (mis) representations of each other. The relationship between China and the United States is now, and will likely continue to be, the most important international relationship of our era. In order to understand present and future challenges and opportunities more fully, this course will examine the long and tumultuous history of US-China relations from colonial America to the present with a historical approach. The course will explore the relationship in actual time and circumstance. Paying equal attention to Chinese and American perspectives, this course will discuss the relationshipÕs diplomatic, economic, and military components, as well as social and cultural interactions. Most nations claim to seek peace, yet war is a recurrent feature of international politics.  This course examines the reasons why this is the case.  Is war an inevitable result of the clashing interests of states, or is it a regrettable consequence of their failure to correctly assess those interests?  We will study the greatest works of political philosophy and political science in order to understand the causes of war and the prospects for a more resilient peace. In 1800, Europeans controlled 35 percent of the earthÕs land surface. By 1914, it was 84 percent; American and Japanese imperialism soon followed. Beyond political control and economic exploitation, culture was instrumental in legitimizing imperial rule through the discourses of civilizing mission, scientific racism, social Darwinism, and in the Japanese case, a co-prosperity for Asians through assimilation. However, colonized peoples contested imperialism and colonialism through cultural practices such as mimicry, ÒsignifyingÓ, literary practice, and critique of liberalism and humanism. This course examines how culture is inscribed in the workings and failings of empires and their legacies. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Global Cultural Studies. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines. The seminar will foster the ability to see their disciplinary knowledge from a wider perspective and to apply it flexibly. Specific topics will vary. This seminar is required for all juniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor.

And, most importantly for a globalizing world: Can we compare ÒculturesÓ? What are the assumptions and parameters that would make such comparison possible in the first place? This course addresses the forces and concerns central to understanding culture and cultural difference. Discussions will pay attention to both the global and local/regional levels on which culture can be observed and compared. Understandings of culture touch upon many forces and concerns, including questions of gender, ideology, religion, nationalism and colonialism. By building a firm understanding of the theoretical approaches to culture, this course will explore the toolbox of comparative cultural studies. A trip to Europe is not complete without Paris and Berlin: cities of light and darkness, of excesses and extremes. In this course, we will take a stroll around these two world capitals in the company of artists, philosophers, filmmakers, and writers as we try to capture the historical, creative, and existential dilemmas of the times. From Nietzsche to Benjamin by way of the open-minded and gender-fluid nightlife of the Weimar Republic; from Camus to Sartre and Beauvoir by way of the cigarettes and experimentation of the Nouvelle Vague, this course will give an overview of what Berlin and Paris were up to between the late 1800s and the 1950sÑand, in doing so, will inquire about the meaning of life. This course combines the disciplinary practices of history, ethnography, media studies, and literature to explore life in the modern city. Through a combination of writing, photography, and film-making, students will explore and document modern city life. Students will study the techniques of writers, photographers, poets, and filmmakers from different eras and cities such as Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, London, Berlin, Hong Kong, Taipei, and New York. They will then practice the methods they have learned, creating a portfolio that includes writing, video-making, and photography to document and analyze changes over time in the life of a big city of their choice in China. Movies are often discussed as a visual medium, with sound treated as an afterthought to the image. Musicals, however, invert this relationship, putting sound front and center. This course examines both the genre of film musicals and musicality in film more generally, asking how film sound and music contribute to (or detract from) narrative, spectacle, affect, and realism. We will discuss a wide range of historical examples, stretching from the 1930s to the present; films may include those from the United States, Brazil, France, Denmark, Japan, and China. This course will provide students with analytic tools for approaching the topic of race on film from a variety of angles. These include issues of visibility, stereotyping, and whether a given film challenges conventions and adds to a larger cultural repertoire for representing race. In addition, it will examine the extent to which stories presumably told from a universal perspective in fact articulate the views of a majority culture, as well as how the facets of our own identities filter what we see on film. Students will hone writing skills and critical thinking, while participating in collegial discussions of a perennially controversial subject. The twentieth century was a time of major transformations in the way war was waged.  In particular civilians were targeted and suffered from direct military and police action in such a way as to produce tidal waves of displaced persons.  This course follows these refugees, seeking shelter from violence, in wartime and after. In this inquiry, we attend to the voices of refugees themselves.  We focus on the terrifying threats they encountered, the actions they took, and their flight and fate during and after war.  We then show the interaction between refugees and agents of empathy, those private or public actors who helped protect and restore the dignity of these victims of war. Is everyone a curator? The etymological meaning of to curate Ð to take care of Ð has become, with the ever-expanding meaning of art and exhibition making, both central to and contested by practitioners who carefully conceptualize, comment, organize, and show art. In this course, we ask fundamental questions of what curation does and should do. We will: 1. look at different theories of curation, illustrated by exemplary exhibitions across the world, 2. learn about curation in its multifaceted practicalities, 3. critically assess new trends in curation and artistic practices at large, 4. have opportunity to curate art exhibitions and/or cultural events on campus.

This course develops skills in translation between English and Chinese in the context of theatre and film. Is performance translatable? How can a translator of subtitles deal with complex cultural references while maintaining brevity and without the luxury of footnotes? Should a translation be loyal to the playwright or to the performer? Can it anticipate audience interpretations and should it guide them? Students compare translations of key works, develop translations for performances within the local community and consider the role of the translator as a mediator of meaning within a complex system of cultural production. None We are familiar with categories such as Anglophone and Francophone that describe literature written in English and French outside of England and France, respectively. We are, however, less acquainted with Sinophone and Japanophone literature as objects of study. What the various Ðphone literatures have in common is the depiction and contestation against the imperial centers from the peripheries. Ranging from a variety of fictional and theoretical texts, films, and images, this course examines the histories, languages, and philosophies of literatures that challenge the logic of imperialism not just in name, but also in its social, political, economic, and cultural legacies. This course considers a variety of literary texts from the perspective of the nexus of cultures and societies in Asia, primarily on modern and contemporary China. This course exposes students to cultural and literary expressions and representations of modern China from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. It explores issues of politics and ideology and the formation of Chinese exceptionalism. The class is divided into two parts: 1. the beginning of the 20th century (1900-1949) and the Mao era (1949-1976); 2. contemporary China since the era of reform and opening up (1978-present). The course takes comparative, interdisciplinary approaches of intellectual and cultural history, literary and cultural studies, and political science. It aims at unraveling the complex relationship of political, ideological formations and cultural, intellectual movements in modern China within the global context of Asia and beyond. This course tracks digital life and creative expression of groups online in a close study of images, captions and hyperlinked tags. It examines rituals, symbols and cultural patterns that structure everyday life of digital tribes online and investigates impact of digital and social media (Weibo, Twitter, Instagram Facebook, livestreaming apps) on the constitution of communities online and offline. Studying varied array of digital tribes: tribes of the deaf, of oil rig workers, of Hindu worshippers, of prison wives and laptop entrepreneurs, students learn about underlying myths, rituals, and cultural symbols that connect groups of people online. For centuries, one story in particular Ð Òthe survival of the fittestÓ Ð has influenced how individuals and communities make sense of their struggles. Challenges of ethnic rivalry and culture clashes, disease and immunity, commerce and poverty, even natural disasters and the threat of human extinction, all have been explained according to this Òlaw of nature.Ó This course surveys a range of literary works and cultural figures that have produced the power of this story in world literature and culture. From Shakespeare to Yuval Noah Harrari, the course analyzes the perils and possibilities that this story holds for our human future. This course examines analog and computer games from a cultural perspective. It explores how prevailing cultures and values affect game design, their popularity, and user experience. By examining the design of games, the course treats games, as cultural artefacts, and aims to understand how they engage broader cultural and political themes, such as imagining disaster, utopia and dystopia. By examining their popularity among different social, gender and ethnic groups, the course investigates contemporary cultural concerns such as gender politics and racial representation. By exploring the user experience, especially in the arena of massively multiplayer role-playing games (MMRPGs), the course investigates questions of role-playing and identity, ethics, group behavior, competition, and politics. What if humans had the power to create intelligent life. What would they do with that power? What would such creatures be like? These questions have captivated the imagination of storytellers for thousands of years. Prometheus stole the power to create life from the Greek gods. The Rabbi of Prague brought a clay creature to life with magical incantations. Frankenstein accomplished it with science on the operating table. And computer programmers try to build such creatures with AI technology. In stories, the end is always the same: the creature gets out of control, it threatens its creator and needs to be subdued. In this course, we will read stories of human effort to bring to life their own creations. We will discuss the literary features of such fantastical creations as the Golem, FrankensteinÕs monster, Androids and AI. Over the semester we will come to appreciate the human desires and fantasies associated with this figure, and ask what these robots and monsters can tell us about our own humanity. What does it mean to be a global citizen? What can literature reveal about the social, cultural, and ethical dimensions of an increasingly interconnected world? What modes of critique, formations of belonging, and possibilities for conceptualizing the world Ñand oneÕs place in itÑ does of literature offer? Through a variety of texts, paired with perspectives drawn from literary criticism as well as sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, this interdisciplinary course will explore the possibilities as well as tensions inherent in differing conceptions of both the ÔglobeÕ and of ÔcitizenshipÕ. This course examines melodrama as a genre in literature and as a mode of representation in film and other media. In examining representative works the course pays attention to key issues in cultural theory, including: gender construction, class formation, racial recognition, and national identity-building. The course places equal emphasis on texts from US and Chinese cultures and uses a comparative method to explore the politics of cross-cultural representation in both societies, leading to a critical understanding of how China is represented in US melodrama, and vice-versa. In our daily lives we are overrun with data, endless bits of information about our environment, health, location, preferences and social contacts. Walter Benjamin has decried this as a modern condition of being bombarded with data, but with no ability or effort to synthesize it into the narrative form in which humans can process and intake it. This course will explore the genre of non-fiction writing as a means to effectively communicate various forms of data. Readings will include examples of leading non-fiction writers such as Sven Lindqvist in cultural studies and history, and Simon Singh in science. The course will also cover basic conventions of citation and reference. Students will practice researching and writing historical, biographical or other fact-based information into narrative form. During the semester, student will also workshop their own researched narrative piece. Online literature constitutes the largest readership and a booming economy in China today. Popular genres include science fiction, urban leisure, martial arts, historical fiction and horror. Successful online novels have millions of followers and are often turned into games, TV dramas and feature films. Subscribers are free to comment on the websites and the fictions they host. How do we understand the proliferation and success of this online literature and its relation to the public sphere? By analyzing the content and the form of online literature in China, the class examines the popularity of online fiction and its socio-economic conditions. The hegemony of American popular culture notwithstanding, cultural products from Japan and South Korea are becoming significant players in the globalization of culture. From the de-Disneyfied anime to the hybridized R&B K-pop, these cultural products challenge American cultural domination, and inspire alternate forms of aesthetics, participation and enjoyment. This course examines the historical formation of Japanese and Korean popular culture, focusing on their contested cultural meanings at the national, regional, and global scales. Some of the issues we will consider include: cultural imperialism, fandom, the role of the state and the development of cultural industry, representations of race and gender, capitalism and transnationalism. This course offers a critical examination of the relation of religion and sexuality with special attention to Buddhist literature and experience. The course equips students with tools from religious theory, gender theory, and critical theory, which are then used to interpret a range of phenomena including: religious interpretations of sex, sexuality, and gender; the codification and normalization of these rules through texts, symbols, and practices; and recent challenges to these interpretations. Topics include homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, gender equality, clerical marriage, married clerics’ wives, and clerical sexual abuse. Places Buddhism in conversation with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. When children are captivated by a story, what elements draw their attention? What stories from our childhoods do we remember for years to come, and why? This course explores writing stories specifically for children from both creative and critical perspectives. We learn to analyze and employ literary techniques and devices like point-of-view, imagery, plot, rhyme, and more. In addition to developing our argumentative writing skills through close reading, we also write and revise our own childrenÕs stories. The course culminates in a special event in which we print and share these stories with their intended audience Ð children. This course introduces students to the essential features of global health from the varying perspectives of natural science, social science, and the humanities, drawing from a variety of conceptual frameworks at different scales (individual, community, country, and global). This course examines the global burden of diseases, how this burden is measured, and debate the utility of interventions used for disease mitigation and prevention. This course also introduces the state of the worldÕs global health infrastructure and explores how that infrastructure might or should adapt to the future world. This course introduces students to ethical theories and frameworks in the context of historical and current issues in global health. As part of this context students learn about best practices and standards of care in clinical settings, so that they can make cross-cultural and transnational comparisons and use these to set up difficult ethical questions about health disparities. The course emphasizes self-reflection, cultural sensitivity, and flexibility in thinking about ethical issues in a globalized world. In the context of historical and current issues, students analyze and critique the choices of multinational, national, and local policymakers; clinicians; and researchers, with an eye to the impact these choices have on individuals, families, and communities. Students also explore ethical issues of conducting research on or working with marginalized/stigmatized populations, using case studies and the theoretical frameworks introduced in the course.  Students are encouraged to think creatively about the relationship between ethics and health and to explore solutions to what appear to be ethical dilemmas in a variety of contexts. Topics include: human rights and development; the ethics of aid; differential standards of care; protection of human subjects; access to essential medicines; genetic information and confidentiality; pharmaceutical development; health information technology; placebo controlled trials; best outcomes vs. distributive justice. This course introduces students to the major social factors that affect public health at both the global and national level.  Globally, students study a wide range of topics from the health impact of global income inequality, gender, and access to education, to the role of specific work place policies, among other topics. Lectures introduce a social variable (such as race or gender), discuss its theoretical underpinnings, and then link it to the current empirical evidence to health outcomes. Students learn to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the empirical evidence. The course considers the implications for intervention strategies and policy, with a focus on applicability to lower and middle-income country settings. Students also study how social factors influence health and well being, with a particular focus on national context in specific countries. Topics could include obesity, aging, socioeconomic disadvantage, access to health insurance, public health systems, the role of the media, and racial/ethnic and gender inequalities. The course provides descriptive assessments of health inequalities and analytic examinations of the mechanisms through which social factors affect health. This course presents the history, social and political context, organization, technical content, funding and evaluation of current, major, global initiatives for disease control. This course emphasizes programs focused on health problems of the developing world and includes, initiatives for vaccines and immunization, non-communicable diseases, safe motherhood and reproductive health, malaria, Neglected Tropical Diseases, HIV, emerging infectious diseases, TB, tobacco control, nutritional interventions and injury control. This course also examines the process of policy formulation and resource allocation to international health and disease control. This course introduces students to the components of health systems (populations, financing, payment, workforce, service delivery, information, medicines and technologies, governance) as they appear in various health system frameworks, and to the ways in which these components and their combinations vary from country to country around the world. The course focuses on comparisons across countries at the same economic level (high-, middle-, and low-income), as well as on comparisons across levels. The course also considers how to assess health system performance, with attention to how measures of performance are invariably tied to often implicit and varying conceptions of health from country to country and culture to culture. Students will learn about the most significant challenges facing health systems within each economic level and about successes and failures in meeting these challenges with health system reforms. The latter part of the course introduces students to the role of politics and policy in strengthening health systems. Throughout the course, students learn not only about health systems but also about what systems (physical, biological, social) are, how they function, and about how systems thinking can be applied fruitfully to the study of health systems. Health issues are rarely isolated. They cross borders and travel through human and non-human channels around the globe.  Global health governance takes place through both multilateral discussions between nations as well as through a variety of organizations that have been created to address the expected and unexpected consequences of global health issues.  This course introduces students to the primary governmental, intergovernmental, private, and civil society actors in global health, offering both a history of how and when these actors came to be, and an account of their shifting interrelationships in the face of evolving global health crises. Students learn about the post-World War II development of the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the United Nations and its agencies on one hand, and about the parallel development of civil society organizations like OXFAM, CARE, and Catholic Relief Services on the other. The course then explores the development of governmental organizations like the CDC and USAID in the United States and an DFID in the United Kingdom, and, in the 1990s and 2000s, the addition of large private actors like the Gates Foundation and new models of governance like the Global Fund and UNAIDS. The course examines the tensions, struggles, challenges, and successes of these international organizations and their relationships and processes, through case studies of how these organizations have interacted, individually and collectively, with various countries and communities in which global health crises have emerged. In this way, the course uses global health governance as a lens through which to view many of the driving issues in global health: HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and a rising tide of new infectious diseases; the alarming global spread of diabetes, obesity, and cancer; the persistence of malnutrition and the deaths of children under five; violence, war, and mental health; and the continuing challenges of reproductive and maternal health. The solutions to all of these pressing global health issues, and many others as well, will be a product of global health governance. Explores interactions between ecosystem health and human well-being in context of global change and human population growth. Effects of climate change on food supply, water availability, land degradation and human well-being; impact of species distribution, disease spread, and human health; ecosystem services and human well-being. Case studies used to illustrate the scientific process and to evaluate supporting evidence. This course covers the basics of the structure and function of major organ systems of the human body in health and disease. The course is geared towards any students who are interested in learning more about how the human body works, how disease develops, and how mind-body connections can alleviate the progression of a disease process. Covers evolutionary approaches to understand human health and disease at a global scale. Integration of evolutionary thinking and medical science provides new insights to a wide array of medical issues including obesity, cancer, allergies, and mental illness. Evolutionary perspectives reveal why some pathogens are more harmful than others, shed light on the origins and spread of infectious diseases in humans, and help in controlling antibiotic resistance. Evolutionary approaches provide insights as to why we age and provide solutions to alleviate human health problems that often differ from modern medical practice. Course will place these perspectives in the context of global health challenges. Course examines global mental health from perspectives of culture, public health, epidemiology, human rights, policy, and intervention. Readings in the course focus on peer-reviewed research literature highlighting topics such as the prevalence of mental health disorders worldwide, the role of culture in mental health, and the interventions backed by strong evidence for prevention and treatment. Students will discuss and critique study methodologies and explore the needs for future research in this emerging field. Course is designed for students with prior research methods and psychology coursework. What factors account for the persistence of poverty in some countries?  Is it always going to be the same way Ð i.e., will poor people remain poor within the foreseeable future Ð or can something be done to reduce poverty (or at least alleviate its most painful consequences)? Academics and policymakers have come up with alternative formulations as they have attempted to deal with poverty over the last 50 years.  This class provides students with an overview of social and economic development in developing countries since the early 1950s. What problems do residents of developing countries face, what kinds of solutions have been advanced to deal with these problems, how have different solutions fared in practice, and what needs to be done now and in future? The course traces how development practice has evolved in the theoretical literature, and students use this knowledge to investigate what needs to be done now and in future. Overview of the key health policy issues in the United States. Topics include: (1) sources of morbidity and mortality; (2) access to health care; (3) financing of health care including an overview of how health insurance works, Medicare and Medicaid and why there are uninsured persons and to what effect; (4) quality of health care; (5) the role of innovation in both treating disease and influencing costs; (6) mental health, including why drug and alcohol treatment is generally considered to be a mental health service; (7) the role of non-profit versus for-profit ownership of health care facilities and to what effect; (8) long term care; and (9) the impact of social phenomenon such as income inequality, social class and culture on health care.

Major topics include the impact of media on health and behavior; use of mass, new, and social media strategies for health promotion, patient-provider communication; and the role of culture in health communication campaign design. Students should have basic understanding of social science research methods. Students will develop the skills necessary to use media strategically to advance public health policies and social change. The course covers the design, implementation and evaluation of media campaigns to promote public health goals, and examines theories and research on media influences with respect to its potential harmful effects on wellbeing. Students will design a digital media-based health communication campaign. An inquiry into the nature of contemporary war in sub-Saharan Africa and its human cost. Uses public health as a parameter to assess the impact of organized collective violence on peopleÕs lives. Link between war and public health established and measured with respect to civilian deaths, gender based violence, physical and psychological trauma, mental disorders, malnutrition and famine, and the spread of epidemic diseases, inter alia HIV/AIDS. Special attention is given to rape as Òa weapon of warÓ, to the trafficking of human beings in war zones, the child soldier phenomenon, and to death counts as a vector of humanitarian or political advocacy. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in Institutions and Governance. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.  Students will re-connect with the broader community of faculty and students in their major and further develop their capacities to translate between their areas of expertise and the larger questions and issues that apply across a variety of disciplines. The seminar will foster the ability to see their disciplinary knowledge from a wider perspective and to apply it flexibly. Specific topics will vary. This seminar is required for all seniors in the major. Other students may enroll with the permission of the instructor. This course explores the nature of risk, particularly as it relates to decision-making in areas such as politics, economics, and finance. The course combines a theoretical overview of risk and the use of simple mathematical models to quantify it. Furthermore, the conditions under which risk specific models are most accurate and useful will be explored, as well as the situations in which they are prone to failure. This course introduces students to the approaches used by social scientists to evaluate the implementation and impacts of public policies. Topics covered include reasons for and uses of program evaluations; the different kinds of information gained through implementation analysis and the integration of qualitative and quantitative research; statistical power and effect size; and cost-benefit analysis. The bulk of the course focuses on the techniques, advantages, and drawbacks of experimental and quasi-experimental designs. This course aims to help students become better academic writers by exploring how the features of a persuasive argument vary across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. The course will first explore fundamental features of argumentative writing for a general audience, including organizational structure and language. Fundamentals in mind, the second half of the course explores how these ideas and practices can be adapted for specific academic purposes. The course will seek answers to the following questions: How do the means of persuasion change depending on the audience? How do disciplinary goals shape arguments? How do cultural and language differences influence persuasion in different contexts? How do citation and style conventions differ across disciplinary contexts and why? This course examines the key actors, institutions, and processes in American politics from an explicitly comparative and rational choice perspective. Topics covered include federalism and the states, the constitution and its interpretation, Congress and its committees, the presidency and bureaucracy, the court system, and voting and elections. For each, America is compared with other advanced industrial democracies, newer democracies, and authoritarian regimes. These comparisons generate insights into what makes America alternately typical and atypical, successful and unsuccessful. Studying American politics from a comparative perspective also sheds light on the effects of reform proposals, suggests new modes of political participation, and informs students about the world’s leading exporter of democracy. This course engages in a series of case studies to evaluate the requirements of political rhetoric, especially during times of crisis. Examples are drawn from ancient Greek and Roman history, the American founding, and the U.S. Civil War. Students will be able to identify how political leaders in various contexts use common logical and rhetorical constructions to negotiate political uncertainty and danger. Populism is widely recognized as a threat to liberal democratic states around the world today. In this course, we will analyze the phenomenon of populism from three basic perspectives. First, we will read theories of what populism is and how it relates to liberal democracy. Second, we will examine what the aims and practices of different populist movements from around the world are (movements such as those in Venezuela, Brazil, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, France, and India). Third, we will investigate what the causes of populism are and how we can respond to it. Much of the policymaking that structures our world emerges not from Congress or the courts, but from regulatory institutions. This course outlines the historical origins and evolution of modern regulatory institutions, focusing on the Western European and North American experience, from the nineteenth century to the present.  For our purposes, Òregulatory institutionsÓ include not only public agencies, commissions, bureaus, and boards, but many quasi-public and private entities as well. As this course will reveal, these varied institutions have complex relationships with the businesses, organizations, and individuals whom they hope to regulate, as well as with legislatures, presidential administrations, and the courts. Course readings and discussions will incorporate a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, and include a discussion of the recent ÒrevoltÓ against regulation.

Fundamental chemical and physical principles underlying the properties of electronic, dielectric and magnetic materials will be developed in the context of metals, semiconductors, insulators, crystals, glasses, polymers and ceramics. Miniaturization and the nanotechnology revolution confront materials science with limitations and opportunities; examples in which nanoscale materials are different from our macro world experience will be explored. Particulate materials, broadly defined as agglomerates of macroscopic particles, are ubiquitous in nature, across industries (pharmaceutics, chemical engineering, geotechnical, etc.) and in our daily lives. You can see them in everything from sand grains on the beach to catalyst particles in chemical reactors and from airborne pollution particles to ice balls forming Saturn’s rings. Starting from a physics perspective, this course builds the foundation for widespread applications of particulate materials. It covers topics including particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions, agglomeration processes, statics and dynamics of granular materials. Students work on specific projects that equip them with essential experimental and/or numerical tools to explore these applications of particulate materials and that prepare them for advanced academic and applied fields of study. The state of matter is dependent upon temperature, thermal history, and other variables. In this course the science of structural transitions is treated, with the purpose in mind of utilizing them for producing materials with superior properties. The subjects covered include the methods of structural analysis, solidification, solid state transformation, and order-disorder transition.

For students of media, it is vital to have some skills in media production or art practice.  This course will introduce students to some practical aspects of media and the arts.  These might include: creative camera control and lighting; how to code a web page; how to write a news story; how to make a documentary, how to do interviews, how to edit media; cultivation of skills in theater, music or art, among others. An emphasis is placed on understanding and experimenting with contemporary technologies that enable digital communications. Media Studies and the Arts explores the cultural significance of the media in the contemporary world. It is a cross-disciplinary field that draws on communication studies, art history, literature, sociology, psychology and philosophy, among others. Particular attention is paid to new media and digital media including those enabled by the technological revolution of the Internet age. The course addresses New Media Art as a specific art historical movement, focusing on technologies, forms, thematic content, and conceptual strategies. While the term, new media art only became in the late nineties the established label for a broad range of artistic practices that exploit new media technologies, many new media artists are profoundly aware of their historical antecedents, making reference to Dada, Pop Art, Conceptual Art, Performance Art, and Fluxus. To understand new media art in a historical context, we will consider the history of technology and media sciences that plays an equally important role in this artÕs formation and reception. The course thus studies the invention of information technologies and a range of human-machine paradigms that impact the landscape of art history, including cybernetics, network, augmented reality, Biomedia, and ubiquitous computational technology. Art has been a part of every society since recorded history. How have the arts told stories about civilizations, ethnicities, communities and peoples? How have the arts evolved and circulated across the globe?  The arts provide vital narratives in our understandings of each other as our cultures have both clashed and shared over time. This course asks these questions by focusing on visual arts across cultures not with the aim of comprehensive coverage, but representation of key issues in the interpretation of art. Students will learn how to interpret art from a critical perspective in terms of its relation to broader social, cultural and political dynamics. Like any craft, making movies is something that takes time, study, and, more importantly, practice. Each film is a unique challenge. What works for one film may not work for another. This is what makes learning about filmmaking an ongoing process. This course includes reading, discussing, and studying of the fundamental elements of video production. Strongest emphasis is in the several short exercises to guide students towards a solid understanding of the building blocks of different types of video production. Student will learn to use digital video cameras and audio equipment, learn basic video editing , and create original work. An emphasis on how to see with the camera and ways of thinking about photographs. Class assignments accompanied by historical and theoretical readings, lectures, class discussions, and field trips.   Course will use photography as a tool for exploring the local community.

As a student of this class you will add to this archive through the act of curation, creation, and outreach. This course will answer the following questions: What is an archive? What is the power of the archive? Who decides what gets put in an archive? What gets left out? The guest lecturers are professionals with backgrounds in curation, archiving, dying and extinct languages, media and medium studies, documentary, and anthropology. New media Ð ranging from the Internet to Twitter and Facebook, from informational networks to handheld devices Ð have in recent years drastically influenced the social relations for individual and communities, and have exerted profound influence on social, economic and political life. The course traces the development of new media, their relationship to previous modes of communication and transmission, and how digital technologies influence emerging and changing spheres of economic, political and social exchanges. Rather that aiming at a comprehensive survey, this course offers an introduction to key moments in the intersection of history, politics and visual art in the world before 1900s. It places art in a global context, highlighting themes from European, Asian, African and Indigenous art and focuses on art as the exercise of cultural power, and the way that artists have both promoted and resisted these entanglements with elite authority. In each case studied, students will gain sufficient historical background to understand the art in question, but will also engage in the comparative study of art to highlight issues of power, religion, class, and gender. This course offers an introduction to central themes in, and methodologies for, analyzing visual culture. Visual Culture is a transdisciplinary field of study that studies the (re)production, circulation, and reception of images as well as everyday practices of seeing and showing in contemporary culture. By focusing on the cultural and social roles of images, the course examines how images circulate through various media including art, design, advertising, video games, pop culture, and digital technologies. Exploring Òways of seeingÓ the visual culture, students will be able to critically read and understand the images and visuality we live with and within. What distinguishes performance from behaviour? From Shamanic practices to national theatres; ritual and pageantry to the performance of everyday life, this course invites students to read gesture, habit and the movement of bodies in space as texts laden with meaning. Students examine different forms of performance in local, global and intercultural contexts to reassess the relationship between body, mind and society and to examine how embodied actions can create meaning, reinforce or challenge power structures and transmit cultural memory. What is creativity? How is creativity related to the artistic process? How can I learn through practice to be more creative? This course first introduces students to major theories about creativity and related fields of innovation and entrepreneurship. Students analyze examples of the creative process in the lives of key artists and creative practitioners. Finally, they also experiment with different creative strategies to help cultivate their own creativity. Recording techniques and audio mixing on digital editing software for the production of audio documentaries for radio, the web, and podcast.

Our subject is the art, content, technology, and life of documentary film. We will study contemporary filmmaking approaches that fall under broad categorization of “documentary,” and show how documentary filmmakers choose and interpret their subjects, themes, and points of view. We will analyze the form, technique, and impact of documentary filmmaking. In the process of considering issues of autonomy and power, politics and public policy, we will begin to define the role of documentary art in public dialogue. Although this course does not include instruction in film production, you may well be encouraged to try your hand at documentary filmmaking. In addition to class lectures and screenings, the course may feature guest filmmakers who will introduce their films and follow the screenings with question and answer sessions. Stories and storytelling surround us.  They have existed since pre-history and continue to fill an essential place in our lives. What goes into telling a story? This is a beginning creative writing course that focuses on igniting the sparks for ideas and shaping ideas into a story. We will emphasize the hands-on exploration of sources for inspiration, idea-formation, building ideas, work-shopping and refining them to form them into a script. We will study the fundamentals of story, structure, character development, genre, building scenes, dialogue, and how to utilize them to write a script for media output including the screen, a podcast, and the stage. With the increasing use of digital media, visual communication is becoming more and more important. This course helps students to express themselves visually and introduces different techniques of Digital Imaging using Photoshop and Illustrator. The focus is not only on retouching and manipulating images, but also on using the computer as a medium to create art and communicate ideas. Digital painting, collages, vector graphics, special effects, matte painting, Photoshop for video and interaction with other media are some of the techniques covered. Photoshop and Illustrator used to introduce single and serial images for print and web output. Emphasis on the tradition and practice of documentary photography as a way of seeing and interpreting cultural life. The techniques of color and black-and-white photography – exposure, development, and printing – diverse ways of representing the cultural landscape of the region through photographic imagery. Issues such as objectivity, clarity, politics, memory, autobiography, and local culture play in the making and dissemination of photographs.  The course will simultaneously consider image content, representations place, landscape, and culture through documentary image. Two questions a film editor must always ask are: What shot comes next? And, why this shot and not that? In this course, students explore answers for these questions by studying and editing different genres, styles, and forms of film and video. The goal is achieved through expanding studentsÕ understanding of editing as both a viewer and as a working editor. To that end, in addition to classroom discussion, readings, and screenings of feature films and excerpts, students will complete several editing projects on digital video. These projects are designed to provide both real-world challenges to solve as well as opportunities to experiment. Knowledge of a video editing program is not necessary at the beginning of the class; by the end you should be extremely comfortable with Adobe Premiere Pro. This course engages with poetic and experimental image-making, utilizing techniques that trace a historical trajectory from celluloid to digital. Students are exposed to exploration of cinematographic principles and cameraless experiments. Teaching methods include lectures, discussion, readings and screenings focusing on avant-garde film and digital traditions. Students are required to produce final projects deriving or departing from course materials. In this course we will explore the components of music. We will try to understand what makes it so elusive, yet so fascinating. On the one hand, we will investigate the elements that constitute it (what is a melody, how it works, how songs are made, why something sounds good or bad, etc.). On the other hand, we will review the principal forms that music has taken in history, focusing mainly on Western music. We will also investigate the cultural conditions under which we listen. We will develop the understanding of those matters primarily through written commentary on the musical and scholarly material encountered. No prior musical knowledge is required. Lectures, discussions and written assignments wonÕt include music notation Motion Design is the creation of animated graphics using graphic design, typography, advertising, photography, animation sound and filmmaking. Students learn the latest technology such as After Effects and 3D softwares but it is the creative intent that motivates the acquisition of technical capabilities.

This course is a wide-ranging introduction to the fascinating world of film and the cinema industry. Here we will look at the language and critical tools we use to understand and interpret films, while considering examples from a variety of geographical, historical, and theoretical backgrounds. Following a primarily historical trajectory, the course will allow students to develop an appreciation of cinemaÕs role in visual culture throughout the 20th century up to our present day. Understanding how movies function, how they become meaningful for their audiences, and how this relationship between moving images and viewers has evolved during the past 120 years, contributes to our further enjoyment of cinema in its various manifestations. At the same time, this deeper appreciation and knowledge allows us to come to grips with the ways in which movies have had an impact on the broader construction of society and human culture to date. Soundtracks, in their interaction with images, are decisive in shaping the narrative of movies. In this course, we will explore uses and functions of music and sound in film, with particular attention to the human voice. We will watch and analyze a wide range of movies and engage with the main aspects of the theory of film sound and its concepts. No prior musical knowledge is required. You will gain a better understanding of how sound helps determining the expressive messages of films. You will also learn to discern different styles and usages of sound in connection with images, and to write about these matters using specific terminology. This course investigates hybrid, genre-defying films that question traditional definitions of documentary and fiction. Emphasis on experimental forms, documentary reenactment, mockumentary and dramatized “true stories.” Students utilize both documentary and fiction production techniques, culminating in the production of a final video project. This course introduces students to theory and practice of the process of writing for the screen. We explore visual storytelling and analysis of screenplays and movies in order to develop original stories into screenplay format. Students will learn to recognize and understand proper screenplay format and structure, understand how screenplay writing is a unique style of writing and why, understand character development and power relationships, and have a better understanding of the business of screenwriting. Through the actual writing of a feature length script, students gain hands-on practice on writing and presenting treatments, outlines, scenes, story planning, character development, communicating information, relationships between script and cinematic dimensions, as well as working with studios and editors. Sports documentaries have a long legacy of excellent storytelling that is used to discuss deep rooted social problems by adding emotional and dramatic power. This class will examine themes ranging from climate change, identity, domestic abuse, institutional cover ups, and systemic racism, to the intersection of sports, crime, and politics. We will discuss the mechanisms used in sports documentary storytelling to explore different traditions in documentary filmmaking as a whole. Screenings and readings will reinforce practice exercises towards the production of your own documentary. This course teaches the language of photography through the study of classic and contemporary photographic essays and through the completion of assigned photographic essays by the students themselves. Students will learn to make, choose, sequence, and pace their own images for class discussion and for digital projection. During the semester students will complete three assigned photographic essays of at least ten images each. Each essay will be on a particular theme or subject to be announced. Project-driven studio course exploring time through video and still photography.

The purpose of antitrust laws is to control how firms attain and maintain their market position, presumably for the betterment of consumers, or at least for the benefit of society. Using a rigorous set of tools from microeconomic and game theory, this class will investigate the underpinnings of policies meant to deal with market power broadly defined, such as antitrust laws, the regulation of public utilities, the regulation of financial markets, and anti-dumping rules. This course examines the place of America in the wider world and the nature of American regional and global engagement. It explores how Americans have viewed and defined themselves in relation to numerous other nations and peoples examines the relation between ideology, politics, culture, and foreign policy. From the framing of the Constitution to the present day, the US has had unique political institutions and political culture, which have long arrested the minds of political theorists, philosophers, writers and academics. Drawing on multiple disciplines, such as sociology, history, philosophy, and literature, this course will explore AmericaÕs democratic political structures as well as the various institutions that live alongside them.  Students will examine the US Constitution and political system. They will look at the relation of the US political system to American culture, to race, to education, to capitalism, and to empire. What is the story of the United States? What fundamental ideas of America have been formed as a nation and as an empire? Are there connections we can draw between the US today and its past? What relevance does the US have in China historically and in the present day? What place does the US have in the Chinese imagination? In this course, we address these questions by examining a variety of texts, ranging from important founding documents, political speeches, autobiographies, and travelogues to excerpts of American novels. Through class discussions, team projects, and role plays, we will discuss fundamental concepts of America, its past and present, and explore themes such as politics and religion, race and slavery, immigration and identity, women and economics, and education and citizenship. We will also consider how America is being perceived in the world specifically within the Chinese context. This seminar is a core component of the interdisciplinary major in US Studies. Students will apply to interdisciplinary topics the knowledge and methods of analysis that they have gained in different disciplines.

The United States of America is founded on the idea of universal equality with respect to moral worth and fundamental rights.  This radical idea, which had no precedent in history, has always been fundamental to AmericaÕs self-understanding and to its singular place in the community of nations. And yet, the concept of ÒothernessÓ has never been far from the surface in American political and cultural life.  An official ideology of equality has never been able to eliminate real inequalities and exclusions that have produced, for some, feelings of entitlement or special distinction, and for many others, feelings of solitude, exclusion, or powerlessness.  A sense of singularity, non-belongingness, apartness, or exceptionalness characterizes many of the most distinctive aspects of American culture.  This tension between what America claims to stand forÑa harmonious society in which everyone has equal moral worth and equal rightsÑand the reality of daily life for those who feel for whatever reason that they stand apart from the whole will be the subject matter of this course.  This subject will be approached by reading foundational texts in which the ideology of equality is articulated, and by considering a wide range of other materials in which this ideology is explored, tested, or challenged. Mega-stars like Steve Jobs and Beyonc\\x8e and key political and cultural figures like Abraham Lincoln and Anne Bradstreet are all routinely described as Òself-madeÓ. The American belief that individuals achieve financial, political and social success exclusively on their own is crucial to understanding the U.S. and its impact on the world. This course looks at the historical origins of self-making and its cultural representations from the colonial era to the present. It prepares students to understand how the theme of self-determination shapes culture, identity and politics in the U.S. and in how Americans often engage with other cultures and countries. This course will survey the history of the present-day United States from precolonial times (pre-1500) to 1876. This was a tumultuous era of American, and world history, fraught with conquest and enslavement, revolutions and civil wars, mass migrations and democratization. This course will particularly investigate indigenous societies, European colonization and African slavery, the American Revolution and the founding of the US nation-state, social movements, sectional conflicts, expansionism and the American Civil War, as well as the reconstruction of American democracy in the wake of the Civil War. Throughout, the course will emphasize the place of the US in global history, the growth of American capitalism, tensions between race and democracy, and the various contributions of women, slaves, merchants, planters, Native Americans, and workers to American culture and politics. This course will survey the history of the United States, from the downfall of Reconstruction (1877) to the present day. Globally, this era was marked by industrialization, the consolidation and collapse of colonial empires, World Wars, socialist revolutions, decolonization, and the emergence of the United States as the worldÕs pre-eminent geopolitical and economic power. This course will investigate AmericaÕs place within these global transformations. It will explore the rise of AmericaÕs industry and the expansion of its frontiers (both within and beyond North America). It will explore the impact of immigrants from across the world upon American society. It will explore AmericaÕs role in two World Wars and the global Cold War. It will also examine the shifts in American politics, from the expansion of womenÕs rights, labor rights, and African American rights, to the New Deal and Neo-Conservatism, to Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Many commentators have observed that the sense of national community in the United States has declined over the past several decades.  In the eyes of some critics, as political debate has polarized and as wealth has concentrated, the nationÕs commitment to community responsibility, eroded by such forces as identity politics and market-based individualism, has shrunk to ever-smaller circles.  This course will explore the so-called ÒAge of FractureÓ in recent U.S. history, paying close attention to debates among public thinkers on both the political right and the political left.  The course uses this material to teach students the basics of academic writing. This course examines American economic history and the global reach of capitalist markets. It explores patterns of commerce, the development of the regulatory state, business cycles and crises, the nature of the corporation and the changing of labor markets and the meaning of work. The course considers crises, contradictions, and competitive virtues and drawbacks associated with the modern American economy and highlights key trade-offs and lessons for democratic institutions, business, and culture. This course explores the intersection between foreign relations and the evolution of American society, with a focus on Asian-Americans in different moments of history. It is divided into three main historical eras and themes: (1) the early period of Chinese emigration and the building of American railroads until the Exclusion Acts; (2) Japanese-American society before and after Pearl Harbor; (3) Chinese Americans in modern American science, engineering, and innovation. Through the use of representative cases, the course trains students to understand the lives of Asian Americans in relevant historical, cultural and political contexts. This course examines the meaning rights and liberties in the American and global context. It considers competing justifications as well as specific legal and policy debates ranging from freedom of speech and the press, religion, sexuality, abortion, and discrimination. This course explores the nearly 50 year conflict between the superpowers of the US and USSR and considers the domestic impact of AmericaÕs Òcold warÓ against communism. It assesses both the ideological clash and the economic conflict between capitalism and state control. Topics include the development of the atomic bomb, George KennanÕs ÒcontainmentÓ strategy, the moon race and military and technology competition and the key historical developments such as the Korean War and the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as relations with China and US influence in Third World countries. This course studies immigrants and immigration policy in the United States from 1850 to the present, with a focus on the origins and power of immigrant exclusion during three waves of migration: Northern European and Asian migrations between 1850 and 1880; Eastern European, Latin American, and Asian migrations, 1880-1920; and Latin American, African, and Asian migrations, post 1965. The course examines the roles of immigrants in shaping policy debates, citizenship rights, labor movements, and American culture, past and present. The course also considers migration patterns and policies in comparison to other major immigrant destinations. The U.S. has been characterized as a Ònation with the soul of a church.Ó This unpacks that statement and explores the distinctive role that religious belief and institutions have played in American life. This course examines religious figures and movements, the role religion plays in politics and public life, the cultural contours of religious popular and social movements, the racial, ethnic and gendered dimensions of religious life, and the nature of individualism and social solidarity in the U.S. This course examines the Founders of the American political order and compares them with the more contemporary founders of other political traditions. This course examines the political thought and careers of key protagonists in the American Revolution and constitutional Founding (such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison) and revolutionaries and founders in other modern settings (such as Mohandas Gandhi, Che Guevara, Nelson Mandela, Vaclav Havel, Mao Zedong, and Lee Kwan Yew). Is the United States an empire? It once colonized the Philippines but then distanced itself from colonial empire at the end of World War II. Ever since, it has wielded power through its overseas military base network and its system of alliances with foreign countries. The objective of this course to engage in a thoughtful, informed discussion about how Americans have interacted with the larger world, and how other peoples have grappled with U.S. power. Students will be asked to formulate their own conclusions about the nature of U.S. power by reading and assessing a variety of scholarly interpretations. What does it mean to be and to become an American citizen?  What combination of political principles, cultural identity, and historical experience does and should constitute U.S. citizenship? This course explores the meaning of citizenship and nationhood in different historical contexts, amidst competing constitutional interpretations, and at the center of contemporary policy debates. to be updated A study of the works and dramatized presence of any number of iconic figures on AmericaÕs cultural stage, which varies each semester according to the expertise of the instructor.  The course could have a pre-Revolutionary focus, treating semi-mythic figures such as Bradford, Wild Bill Hickock, Pocohantus, Morton, Adams and Hamilton.  It might look at mid-19th century such as Andrew Jackson, Sitting Bull, Abraham Lincoln, John Brown, Fanny Fern, Thomas Dartmouth Rice, ÒLittle Eva,Ó ÒStagger Lee,Ó and ÒJohn Henry.Ó  Or it will focus on more recent icons, from Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Houdini, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Valentino, and Mae West in the early decades to Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland (to cite only the singers) at mid-century to Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King in the sixties (to cite only the politicos) or even Madonna, Tupac, Gaga, Beyonc\\x8e and Kendrick Lamar (back to the musicians).  A study of the interplay among their arts, their celebrity personae, and their impact on ethnic, national, and international scenes. This course introduces a range of works from the US canon that engage the concept of travels in relation to the themes of race and slavery, gender and sexuality, and citizenship and empire. Through reading some great American novels, we will explore travels and mobility from pre-Civil War to modern America, and from the slave-holding south to multiracial and multicultural metropolises both within and beyond the US borders. By drawing connections between these great American novels, we will discuss how they collectively cross and challenge national, geographical, and political boundaries of the color lineÂÂÐÐand importantlyÐÐhow they resonate with DKUÕs core concept of Òrooted globalism.Ó After Whitman and DickinsonÕs Romantic call to the world beyond U.S. borders, this course turns to the controversy between the rootedness of Frost, William Carlos Williams, and Langston Hughes and the internationalism of Stevens, Eliot, H.D. (including the Sino-philia of Pound), both of which can also be seen as belated forms of Romanticism.  Possible attention to later explorers of such issues as Robert Duncan, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, and Frank OÕHara; to the populist challenge of song lyric (blues, tin pan alley, folk, rock, hip-hop); or to the problems of translation and translatability. This course examines the history of African narrative, drama, poetry, and such expressive arts as the sermon, the political address, and popular music. Narratives are placed in the context of the history of slavery, emancipation and the continuing struggle for civil rights. Topics include: questions of self-identity and American citizenship; the reception of African American literature overseas; the construction of pan-African identities and politics; literature of the African American diaspora; and the concept of home. Students will gain a cross-cultural understanding of the African American experience and its ongoing significance in American life and politics. A course on the major antebellum prose writers (Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, Hawthorne), the storytellers of enslavement (Douglass, Jacobs, Equiano, Brown) and Native displacement (Child, Sedgwick), and the poetry (Whitman before and after the war, Dickinson, possibly late Melville) that ensued. This course examines the history of American musicals, focusing on the period from Show Boat to Sondheim with attention to poetics, aesthetics, and politics. It demonstrates how the American musical has functioned as a popular representation of key themes such as immigration, race and gender and sexual diversity. Students will learn to identify historical and cultural references, and place the evolution of the musical in its proper social and historical context, including the significance of Broadway and New York in the popular American cultural imagination. Students learn to interpret music as text and understand the relationship of musical theater to other musical forms such as blues, jazz, pop and rock. This course is focused on the fiction, primarily the novel, that distinguishes the American literary response to the phenomena of ÒmodernityÓ in the 1920s and 1930s: modernization, urbanization, the rise of consumer and finance capitalism, the Harlem Renaissance and ÒNew NegroÓ Movements, the anti-immigration and Indian citizenship acts, the press of ethnic upward mobility, and the European literary experimentation called Òmodernism,Ó the world-entailing crash of the U.S. stock market.  To be drawn from the works of: Stein, Cather, Wharton, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Larsen, Toomer, Schuyler, Hurston, Barnes, Hammett, Roth, McKay, Faulkner, DiDonato, Steinbeck. This course examines the history of Asian-descent literature including fiction, memoir, poetry, drama) and, to a lesser extent, expressive cultures (film, martial arts, music) with special emphasis on Chinese America. Topics include broad themes of cultural identity, memory and belonging, gender and class, as well as specific issues of the relationship between diaspora communities in the US and national cultures in Asia. Texts are placed within the context of the history of Asian American acclamation, focusing on tensions between cultural assimilation into mainstream America and the pressure to maintain distinctive cultural identities. Columbus and other narratives of European exploration, conquest, and settlement; the interplay of Puritan literature (Bradford, Winthrop, Wigglesworth, Mather, Bradstreet), Native oral traditions, Phyllis WheatleyÕs poetry, and early captivity narratives; the pre-revolutionary novel (Rowson, Foster, C.B. Brown); and the revolutionary texts (The Federalist Papers). WomenÕs, ethnic, and especially ethnic womenÕs writing from the breakthroughs of Walker, Morrison, Hong Kingston, Bambara, Silko, Joan Chase, and Paule Marshall to the glory days of Erdrich, Naylor, Alvarez, Cisneros, Anzald\\x9ca, Jen, Kogawa, Adrienne Kennedy, Suzan-Lori Parks, andÑof courseÑMorrison again, along with their male dissenters and allies, such as Ishmael Reed, Charles Fuller, Tony Kushner, Charles Johnson, Chang-Rae Lee, Oscar Hijuelos, Richard Rodriguez, David Henry Hwang, Junot Diaz, and Ron Hansen. This course focuses on the fictional, theatrical, cinematic, poetic, and new-journalist representation of the Cold War and its ÒHotÓ manifestations (the Korean and, especially, the Vietnam War, as well as the violent turns in U.S. Radicalism).  From the rise of postmodernism and the Beat era (Kerouac, Ginsberg, OÕConnor, Williams, Miller) through treatments of the Civil Rights Movement, the New Left, and various manifestations of the Counter Culture (Eastern religions, the sexual revolution, communes, Afro-naturalism, Rowan and MartinÕs Laugh-In), especially the anti-War Movement and Black Protest movements, to whatever of the 1970s (belated Vietnam films, feminist impact, etc.) works for closure. The interview is a vital research tool that crosses forms of media and academic disciplines. However, it can be difficult to know how to conduct a good interview. How does an interview succeed or fail, and who is its audience? Can the interview be an artform in itself? This course explores interviews in various contexts, including popular culture, to analyze the audience expectations and research implications of interviews. Students will build argumentative writing skills by analyzing interviews. They will also conduct a series of interviews themselves, gaining experience as interviewers and interviewees. This course focuses primarily on realism (Howells, James, Gilman, Harper, Johnson), naturalism (Dreiser, Norris, Crane), and regionalism (Twain, Jewett, Chopin, Chesnutt) during the rise of consumer-managerial capitalism, first-wave feminism, and Jim-Crow Reconstruction. Possible attention to early utopian fiction (Adams, Bellamy, Gilman, Howells) or the impact of journalism (Dreiser, Crane, Henry Adams, Jane Addams, and the muckrakers) on fiction. This course studies the film genre that has, for better and for worse, defined what it means to be an American for Americans themselves and for the rest of the world. It places these films in the historical context of the American westward expansion, and the genocide of native Americans. It examines these films through the myths of the American pioneer, rugged individualism, heroic masculinity, and drama of the American landscape.  By focusing on the concept of crossing boundaries, the course analyzes the concept of the frontier, the representation of frontier communities including Chinese and Irish immigrants, Hispanic peoples and native Americans. This course treats issues of the globe in the U.S. and the U.S. in the globe, as imagined in both Maximalist fiction of various orders (DeLillo, Wallace, Silko, Butler, Delaney, Chabron) and the auto-ethnographic and multicultural contact novel (Morrison, Lee, Cole, D\\x92az, Shteyngart, Adichie, Hoessini, Hamid, Beatty, Whitehead) centered in the multicultural U.S.–as well as whatever global anglophone writing (Sebald, Mitchell, Coetzee), the graphic novel (Speigelman, Satrapi, Sacco, Eisner, Bechdel, the Hernandez brothers), or serial television (The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad) works for a particular semester. Overview of patterns in Americans’ engagement in and disengagement from civic life. Theories of why people do (and do not) participate. Differences across lines of gender, race, ideology, generation, and class. Role of American interest groups and social movements in policy change. Influence of public policies (e.g., federal tax laws, participation requirements, programs such as AmeriCorps) on civic and political participation. Implications for equality, voice, and the health of American democracy. Immigrants and immigration policy in the United States from 1850 to the present, with focus on origins and power of immigrant exclusion during three waves of migration: Northern European and Asian migrations between 1850 and 1880, Eastern European, Latin American, and Asian migrations, 1880-1920, and Latin American, African, and Asian migrations, post 1965. Immigrant roles in shaping policy debates, citizenship rights, labor movements, and American culture, past and present.'"

    "- NLTK is specialized on gathering and classifying unstructured texts. If you need e.g. a POS-tagger, lemmatizer, dependeny-analyzer, etc, you'll find them there, and sometimes nowhere else. It offers a quit broad range of tools developped mainly in academic research. But: most often it is not very well optimized - involving NLTK libraries often means to accept a huge performance loss. If you do text-gathering or -preprocessing, its fine to begin with - until you found some faster alternatives.\n",

It is very well documented (with a lot of ready to use recipes and examples), well optimized, and covers a broad range of ‘state of the art’ machine learning and statistical methods, the latter especially for evaluation purposes. Due to its integrity, it is ideal to start learning ‘machine learning’.\n",

That is: it offers an easy, surpringly well working and swift AI-approach to unstructured raw texts, based on a shallow neural network. If you are interested in prodution, or in getting deeper insights into neural networks, you might also have a look on TensorFlow,\n",
